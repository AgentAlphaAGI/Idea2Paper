It seems the results on mBERT and XLM-R give different conclusions. The relatively small differences between $\\phi=0$ and $\\phi=1$ in the mBERT and XLM-R settings also make me wonder if the differences are statistically significant.\n- The proposed work is an extension of previous Zhang et al., 2020.

The experimental results show that this method outperforms general sampling method baselines in zero-shot learning and achieves state-of-the-art when using mBERT and XLM-R.
