The work is comprised of three main parts: development of a technique for mining argumentative statements which correspond to a given moral position from text; integration with IBM Project Debater’s narrative generation API to generate arguments pro/con a given topic which match a given moral position; and, a detailed user-study assessing the impact of morally-framed arguments on audiences of different political ideologies.\nFor mining of morally framed statements, a BERT classifier based on data collected automatically using distant supervision was used. This approach is clearly explained and produces good results, with the proposed model outperforming both a lexicon-based baseline and existing work for four of the five moral foundations (for 'care' the lexicon-based approach performed better than the other two).\nThe user study described was carefully planned and executed. Although the results were not 100% conclusive, they suggest a clear impact of moral framing on both liberal and conservative audiences, with both being more affected by moral arguments, and liberals in particular finding arguments with relevant moral framing more effective. ", "summary_of_strengths": "Overall the paper is well written and clear, providing interesting insights on the effects of moral framing on persuasiveness. The implementation work is well described and highly reproducible. The BERT classifier used for identifying morally framed statements shows good results, which although not perfect, show a solid improvement over existing work.\nAlthough previous work in the field has addressed belief-based claim generation, there has been little to no work previously assessing the persuasiveness of such claims on an audience. As such, the user study included in this paper is extremely welcome and offers good indication that moral framing can impact how arguments are received. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "The only real concern here may be how well other factors are controlled for in the user study. With the method described for extracting morally framed argument components on a given topic, it is possible that other differences may also be present. Some of these may be connected to the moral position -- certain moral positions may bring with them certain phrasing or aspects of the topic that are more appealing to a given audience. And some of these may arise by chance given the relatively small sample size. I do not view this as a major weakness, but it may benefit from some further consideration. ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "The assignment of a single moral label to a sentence seems quite definitive. It may be more often the case that a sentence corresponds somewhat to two or more moral foundations, and this might be better modelled as a score for each foundation. Is this something that has been considered?\nThe sentence starting on line 279 (\"Having considerable higher effectiveness on average signals the advantage of using the proposed dataset.\") seems incomplete?

What does precision look like here?  But on the other hand, the results so far are clearly making a lot of mistakes.  At the very least, if this is a compelling problem, the paper should spend some time on error analysis and insight.  If the inferences of the ML method are bad enough, it undermines all the contributions later on.\nThe human subjects experiments are small -- six subjects.  This isn't a deal breaker but it's uncomfortable, and the presentation doesn't really acknowledge that this is a preliminary evaluation (percentages with three significant figures, top numbers bolded, no statistics, no acknowledgment of the key status of particular individual items or raters as potential outliers).  It's also an evaluation on a proxy task.  The paper is forthright about the ethical issues that come with trying to persuade people but I found it a bit hard to understand what the ultimate vision was: a system that can provide people with the reasons for and against a proposal they'd find most compelling?  The arguments here seemed all to have the same direction -- all in favor, all against, but with different moral bases.  Why would you want such a one-sided summary?
