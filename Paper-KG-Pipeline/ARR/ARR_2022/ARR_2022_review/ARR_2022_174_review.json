Authors could have investigated Vrank predictions, towards understanding where the model makes mistakes. Assuming that Vrank would be adopted to evaluate VIST models, it is crucial to know its limitations. Additionally, this could serve as guidance to collect extra annotations to mitigate those mistakes.  2. Vrank does not account for the actual images. This is somehow reflected in the correlation results of Vrank for Obj and Event error types. This seems to be a weakness of the proposed approach since by definition, it is trying to imitate human judgment, but without access to the same information that annotators had to decide.  In the Appendix, \"Model Design\" section, authors state that tried vision and language models but do not provide details. What was actually tried? Did it improve in detecting Obj and Event error types?\n3. Given the insights gathered by the authors, I would expect a critical discussion regarding the inclusion of Vrank in VIST evaluation protocols. Namely, provided that Vrank also has error, the best possible automatic protocol would include only Vrank or be complemented with other metrics?

The authors collect VHED, a dataset containing semantic quality scores for several human and machine-generated stories. Thanks to their data collection, they are able to collect very fine-grained evaluation data for 13,875 story pairs. An error analysis of the collected dataset is performed which sheds some light on the properties of the stories. First of all, human references are not always the best reference: 38% of the machine-generated stories are actually better than human-generated ones. Additionally, 79.8% of machine-generated stories have at least one error (according to their detailed classification).   Using such a dataset, they develop VRank as a reference-free model for story generation evaluation. This is a model finetuned on the VHED dataset starting from the SIMCSE pretrained model. The model receives in input the two stories (separated by [SEP]) and generates a score to predict the ranking gap. The model is then finetuned by minimising the MSE loss. The results of the evaluation show that Vrank has better performance than model-based and n-gram based evaluation methods. Another interesting part of their analysis is that they use their model for evaluating text-only stories as well showing very promising results. ", "summary_of_strengths": "1.

I suspect that some controversy because the author's metric is i) model-based; and ii) trained directly on human ratings, but the authors make a compelling case that our current metrics simply are not working for this setting. In some sense, the results are not surprising: of course the learned metric does better in the evaluation setting that it was trained in. But, the fact that it also does well in a unimodal setting suggests that the model has not overfit to particular spurious factors in the corpus, which is promising. Overall --- I think the authors make a convincing case for their model-based metric. And, the fine-grained evaluations in table 5 provide some perspective on where the metric could be improved, e.g., accounting more for grammatically and irrelevant nouns. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "Of course, training on human judgments directly is not a panacea. There's always the concern that whichever pairwise comparisons were originally collected won't generalize to future corpora, e.g., if the models improve in the future, will the particular model generations that Vrank was trained on become \"stale\"? \nThat being said, because the current evaluation metrics are essentially performing at random for the story generation setting, even a stale Vrank couldn't possibly be worse.\nThe author's contribution is in visual story generation evaluation; the task itself is somewhat niche, and so, while I think folks who evaluate on this dataset/setup should use this dataset, I suspect that the work's works impact will mostly be focused on that specific community.\nOne small technical concern: For Table 4, The BLEU-4 score is suspiciously low, especially in comparison to SacreBLEU, which also computes BLEU-4. My suspicion is that BLEU-4 is often zero for some stories, which leads to many ties of 0 vs 0. I think that ties should be broken randomly, or that the authors should mention this is the cause (if indeed my suspicions are correct).
