Specifically, they aim to use uncertainty measures to identify unanswerable questions based on the probability distribution of the answer choices provided. They use ReColr MRC dataset for their experiments. First, they create a data variation that replaces one of the choices with 'None of the Above' to create a dataset with 25% unanswerable questions. Then, they perform experiments with Electra PLM using expected entropy over the answer choices as the metric that measures uncertainty. First, they show that under a harsh negative-penalty (3:5) for wrong answers, abstaining from answering a certain amount of questions improves the overall performance. They observe that it doesn't really help in case of more common/usual negative penalty schemes such as 3:1. Then, they use the data manipulation to train explicit and implicit models to see if the uncertainty measure would help the implicit model perform reasonably in comparison to the explicit model. They observe that the implicit model shows some meaningful gains over a weaker MAP model.  Contributions: 1) Exploring uncertainty measures in detecting unanswerable questions in MRC 2) Demonstrating the use of explicit entropy uncertainty measure for this use case ", "summary_of_strengths": "Strengths: 1) Detecting unanswerability in MRC questions is an important research question and using uncertainty measures over output probability distribution is a valid experimental endeavor 2) The insights obtained via the analysis in the paper are interesting ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "Weaknesses: 1) The paper doesn't present any clear hypothesis and experimental set-up to validate their hypothesis. Neither do the authors explore the issue of unanswerability in MRC in exhaustive detail. They fail to account for previous works on this task (https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/4619/4497) 2) The claims made in the abstract are unsupported in the results. The authors claim that \"it is shown that uncertainty outperforms a system explicitly built with an NOA option\". But, the results of the Implicit system are inferior to that of the Explicit system. The explicit: option A system is not a meaningful system in itself. \n3) The results of the negative penalty scheme show that the proposed uncertainty measure is not that useful in common cases such as 3:1. The authors fail to explore reasons for this, neither do they attempt to experiment with other MRC datasets to see if this is ubiquitous. This makes the exploration incomplete. \n4) The writing of the paper is quite convoluted. The paper is not divided into motivation, hypothesis, proposal, experimental design, results, discussion and related work clearly. Most of the sections are a mix of several of these componenets.

From what I can tell, most of the analysis is performed on the results of one optimised model (ensemble), on one dataset (ReClor).

It would be interesting to see, whether the reported results pertain across different datasets. For example CosmosQA (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00277.pdf) comes with built-in unanswerable questions. This work should be mentioned. \n - While most of the results are clear, I had difficulties interpreting the figures. What makes it difficult is that they all have different axes and threshold over different values. I believe compacting section 2 that discusses the high-level overview of the MC-MRC task to create more room for more thorough explanations of the results would be beneficial. This could be done by providing more informative captions of the figures or linking back to the equations and introduced names (e.g. beta).

It is not clear which hyper-parameters are selected from. Appropriate information should be added, at least in the appendix.\n- What is \"Fraction unanswerable\" in Figure 5 and how is it obtained?\n- I don't believe it is fair to make the comparison in Table 4. While the manuscript acknowledges that, it does not mention the precise nature of the unfairness. The point is that for MAP, the %UNANS is based on model predictions, it's not a parameter that can be freely chosen, unlike the Implicit method. Here, the dev-mixed set was used both for reporting the final accuracy comparison and to select the best %UNANS threshhold for implicit. It would be more fair to either estimate %UNANS from the training data (i.e. 25%) or to split the DEV-mixed in half, use one half to estimate the best %UNANS threshhold and the other half to compare Implicit with the chosen threshhold to MAP. This wouldn't change much of the argument as from what I can tell from Figure 5, Implicit is still better than MAP with %UNANS of 25.
