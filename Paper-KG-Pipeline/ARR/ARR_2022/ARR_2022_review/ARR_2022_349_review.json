This dataset contains complex types of chapter transitions that require long-range context understanding. The authors evaluate previous long-range language models on the challenge dataset, such as Big-Bird and Routing Transformer. They observe all models perform poorly compared to a segment-based RoBERT model trained on the suffix identification task. The authors assume the accuracy of suffix identification is a more useful metric than PPL for long-range context understanding evaluation. ", "summary_of_strengths": "1. A new task (suffix identification) is proposed for evaluating the long-range context understanding ability of language models. \n2. Some previous typical models are evaluated on the new dataset, which can facilitate future works. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "1. The previous LRLMs perform poorly on suffix identification compared to the RoBERTa-based model, which is trained with this task. The LRLMs may have better results when also trained with this task. The authors need to show their task is more useful than vanilla language modeling task on more downstream tasks, such as QA or summarization. ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "(1) The authors claim that the ChapterBreak (suffix identification) is more chanllenge on long-range understanding tasks. However, in order to show the effectiveness of the suffix identification task task, the long-range Transformer model pretrained with the task need to have powerful performance on the downstream understanding tasks than vanilla language modeling. The authors can give more results about that, following previous works (Big-Bird or Longformer)?
