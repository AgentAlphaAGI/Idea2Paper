The authors explore the effect of 3 factors on the transfer with simple concatenation-based DocNMT: the number of teacher languages with document level data, the balance between document and sentence level data at training, and the data type of document level data. The experiments are conducted on Europarl-7 and IWSLT-10 show the feasibility of multilingual transfer for DocNMT, particularly on document specific metrics. ", "summary_of_strengths": "A simple approach uses different proportions of sentence-level and document-level data to train and study its impact on translation performance.

Expect to see experiments that compare with the baseline of the papers you cited. \n3. p indicates the proportion of documents, I would like to know how the parts of sentences and documents are extracted? Do the rules of extraction have any effect on the experiment? I hope to see a more detailed analysis. \n4. It lacks case study to show which document-level translation errors are improved by the proposed method. ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "1. It is suggested to add a structure diagram to illustrate your proposed method. \n2.

If so, then why? This part is unclear... - Is the motivation for using 64K token vocabulary for Europarl the larger size of the training data? The IWSLT data set has a far more diverse variety of languages/writing systems/characters, so it would seemingly make more sense use a larger vocabulary for that instead.
