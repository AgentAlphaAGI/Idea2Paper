The hypothesis is that for any arbitrary text there exists a continuous prompt whose discrete projection is said arbitrary text *and* whose resulting performance is almost as good as the best possible continuous prompt. Therefore, the paper suggests, it is difficult to evaluate continuous prompts in a discrete space because there always exist good continuous prompts that map to random or misleading discrete text.\nA little more formally, the hypothesis is that for any downstream task and arbitrary text $p_d$ of length L, there exists some continuous prompt $\\tilde{p}_c$ of length L such that $\\tilde{p}_c$ results in a test loss close to that of the best continuous prompt $p^*_c$ of length L, and yet $\\tilde{p}_c$ projects to $p_d$ (when projected into discrete space).\nThe authors empirically confirm this hypothesis by showing that for five downstream classification tasks they are able to find continuous prompts which project to certain arbitrary sentences (at least very closely, as evaluated by F1) but whose resulting accuracy is almost as good as that of the optimal prompt (as evaluated by the difference in test accuracy). These experiments use the GPT-2-large model (except when model size is ablated), and projection is defined as follows: continuous prompts are projected to discrete space by finding the token with the nearest-neighbor embedding (where token embeddings are taken to be GPT-2's embedding matrix). Finally, the paper discusses implications of the prompt waywardness hypothesis, the main implication being that continuous prompts may never be interpretable by being projected to discrete language.

The experimental results are thorough and convincing; the paper provides a strong analysis section evaluating the effects of hyperparameters, model size, and prompt length. \n3. The paper discusses implications of the hypothesis: the difficulty of interpreting discrete prompts and the untrustworthiness of discrete projections of continuous prompts. \n4. The conclusion that encouraging continuous prompts to project to semantically accurate instructions (Appendix B) provides interesting insight into the function of continuous prompts. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "The implications discussed in the paper apply *if* one were to try to project continuous prompts to discrete space using GPT-2's (or any other) embedding matrix, but, as far as I am aware, no one has attempted to interpret continuous prompts in this way. The paper could be strengthened by more explicitly discussing *why* we should be concerned with this particular method of prompt interpretation: 1. Do the authors think we should be especially concerned about nearest-neighbor, embedding matrix projections because that's how language model outputs and word2vec are calculated? This seems to be the case, but could be made more explicit. It's not clear why the use of an embedding matrix at the output layer of language models implies this would be a popular way of discretizing continuous prompts. \n2. Is it because the particular discrete projection studied is the simplest that the authors believe it might be used in the future? \n3. Do the authors think their hypothesis generalizes to other methods of discretely interpreting prompts? If so, that could also be made more explicit. ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "1.
