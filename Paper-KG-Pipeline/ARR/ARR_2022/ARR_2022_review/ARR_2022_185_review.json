The authors draw several key conclusions about BERT via this paraphrase-based analysis. ", "summary_of_strengths": "The idea of controlling for meaning with paraphrases is unique and promising. It is clever in that instead of focusing on the ways in which context should change the meaning of words, it focuses on the specific contexts which should cause the meanings to converge. This allows for more precise control over what we expect should happen. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "The meaningfulness of these conclusions strongly depend on PPDB being true paraphrases. If they aren't paraphrases in all dimensions and in the strictness sense, it's unclear that one is truly controlling for meaning. In many example paraphrases shown in the paper, it's clear that one wouldn't not expect representation to be the same for even an ideal representation. For example, \"are mad\" and \"'re out of your mind\" can and often do have different meanings. Even for the highest rated paraphrases such as \"where did they come from?\" vs \"where are they from\" can mean drastically different things, and it's unclear whether a representation that has an identical interpretation of those two phrases is what we really want. ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "I would recommend revisiting strong assumptions being made in this paper. No two sentences mean exactly the same thing, even before discounting noise from PPDB. How these analyses are affected by differences in sentence or phrase meanings should be a big part of the discussion.
