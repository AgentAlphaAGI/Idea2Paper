The main novelty lies in introducing the rationales though a ranking constraint. The newly introduced model is empirically compared with several others from prior work. The new model outperforms those baselines when little data is available. ", "summary_of_strengths": "The idea of a ranking constraint is very interesting and as far as I'm aware is novel. The comparison with other work is sensible as is the choice of baseline tasks.  The paper is easy to read. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "The experimental setup is a bit weak in my view. The choice of baselines covers related work, but it doesn't cover possible variations of the model, such as a non-BERT ranking baseline. The SVM and LR baselines both use the \"old\" style of using representations. I would honestly expect this kind of investigation from a paper that emphasizes the role of the ranking constraint and even puts it in the title.  In addition, the presentation of the main results makes it difficult to see the strengths of each model. The graphs are cut off at around 250 training documents even though some datasets contain much more. It appears as if the rivaling models start to converge after a while. Yet the analysis in table 1 suggest that the new model indeed promises overall improvements that the others cannot achieve (for example 85% accuracy on ASRS).
