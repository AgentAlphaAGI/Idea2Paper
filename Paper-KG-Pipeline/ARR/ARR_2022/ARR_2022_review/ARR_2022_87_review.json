The enhanced model shows improvement compared to the original T5 model. ", "summary_of_strengths": "- The paper is overall well-written (though the organization seems confusing, to be detailed in \"Weaknesses\") and the figures are helpful for understanding the paper.\n- The method is intuitive and relatively simple. The semi-structured tabular data are easy to obtain (from Wikipedia or Common Crawls) so the application of this method is promising.\n- The introduced momentum sampling strategy is interesting and can be useful for multi-task training.\n- The improvement on the four datasets are significant. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "### Original comments - The novelty is limited. This paper mainly uses a template-based generation strategy for EG. Similar techniques have been used in prior works of question generation and semantic parsing.\n- The organization of this paper is confusing. Why there is a \"related work\" subsection in Ln. 323 while there is a whole section of related work (Section 6)? If the authors feel like the related work should be discussed earlier, I suggest moving Section 6 to after the introduction.\n- More baselines should be compared. GenBERT is a very relevant baseline but I think other methods that enhance LM with external knowledge (e.g., KBERT, KnowBERT) should also be compared.\n### After revision The authors reorganize the paper and I have seen improvement in the quality of writing. Also, I've seen the authors have addressed the questions of other reviewers. I thus have updated my recommendation from 3.5 to 4.
