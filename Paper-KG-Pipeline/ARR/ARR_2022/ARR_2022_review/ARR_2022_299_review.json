The authors accomplish this goal with an interesting implementation without introducing additional parameters.

A refinement operation will be conducted at a previous position, where the refinement probability is greater than the generation probability.\nTo reduce the computational cost and potential risk of \"over-refinement\", the authors design a local constraint that narrow the refinement span to the N nearest tokens.

Do you follow Kasai et al., (2021) to measure inference speed when translating in mini-batches as large as the hardware allows. I guess you report the batch decoding speed since the number is relatively high.
