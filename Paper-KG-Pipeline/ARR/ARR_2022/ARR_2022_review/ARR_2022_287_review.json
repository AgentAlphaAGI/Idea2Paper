The authors first critically analyse the state of the art in stereotype detection. Based on the resulting insights, they propose a new 4-way classification setup that is more suitable for the task and that guarantees a more systematic analysis of language phenomena in real-world data. Due to the limits of previously defined datasets, they propose a data collection to derive a crowd-sourced dataset based on Reddit content. Additionally, they use the same annotation protocol to analyse previous datasets as well. However, stereotype detection is a task with very few accurate data points. Therefore, they rely on the intuition that other related offensive language datasets could be used to boost performance. This is mostly because offensive language phrases are typically relying on specific stereotypes. In their evaluation, they use 6 offensive language datasets in a multi-task learning regime. This multi-task learning regime can be further enhanced with a policy that decides which data points to consider for training based on the classification performance. The policy is trained via an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm to optimise the F1 measure of the classification task. The authors tried this approach with several large-scale language models showing substantial performance improvement over the corresponding baselines. ", "summary_of_strengths": "1.

The multi-task learning approach defined in Section 4.1 is not described in detail. There are several ways of performing multi-task learning and the authors should be a little bit more precise in the description of their model. For a more systematic description of MTL approaches for Deep learning models, please refer to https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05098. \n2. Multi-task learning generally struggles when tasks of different complexities are combined together (e.g., see GradNorm for a possible solution: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02257). On the other hand, the authors assume that multi-task learning is going to work without putting much effort into studying how each task affects the others. \n3. The authors perform an ablation where the model is trained using each neighbour dataset together with the reference dataset. However, to show the power of using multiple related tasks at the same time, it would be beneficial to see the effect on the overall performance, of different combinations of datasets. ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "Regarding the issue 1) and 2), I believe the authors should better describe their MTL approach and properly localise it in the literature. Additionally, the authors should provide more details about the training regime and what is the effect of combining different tasks at once. In this sense, weakness 3) can be useful to solve all the others. In particular, I would suggest the authors take their `bert-base` classifier, and train using MTL with different dataset combinations. For instance, assuming that their reference task is S and the related tasks are T_1, T_2, ..., T_6, I would evaluate the following combinations: 1. T_1 + S 2. T_1 + T_2 + S 3. (...) \n4. T_1 + T_2 + ... + T6 + S (this is the version with all the datasets that is currently implemented in the evaluation) In this sense, Table 4 goes in this direction. However, I believe the evaluation should focus on the performance of the stereotype detection task only because is the reference task for this paper.
