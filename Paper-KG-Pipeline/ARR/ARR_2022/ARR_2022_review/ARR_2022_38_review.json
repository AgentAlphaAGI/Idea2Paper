The framework involves a time-sensitive approach to learn temporal KG embeddings, and contrastive losses to improve answer retrieval, and enhance the model's ability in capturing temporal signals. The proposed architecture significantly outperforms state of the art models on the CronQuestions dataset. ", "summary_of_strengths": "1. The paper is well written and presents the simple yet subtle techniques to incorporate time-sensitive information while learning temporal KG embeddings and model training for T-KGQA. \n2.

One research question I hoped to see was the amount of data required to ensure the TSQA framework could be applied to other datasets. The gains in performance comes from learning the TKGE embeddings and the inclusion of the contrastive losses. It would be interesting to observe whether the gains would remain as steep if trained on a fraction of the original dataset.
