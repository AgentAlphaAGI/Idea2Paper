The selling point of this paper is unsupervised pretrained dense retriever(LaPraDoR) can per- form on par with supervised dense retriever, but actually, LaPraDoR is a hybrid retriever rather than a pure dense retriever. In a way, it’s unfair to compare hybrid method to dense/sparse method as shown in table 1, because it’s known that the dense retriever and sparse retriever are complementary. The comparable supervised models should also be hybrid retrievers. Besides, in table 3, it seems that without lexicon enhancement, the performance of proposed unsupervised model is not competitive either on in-domain MS-MARCO or cross domain BEIR benchmark compared with supervised model. \n2. In table 4, the combination of self-supervised tasks ICT and DaPI doesn’t seem to be com- plementary, the effectiveness of DaPI task, which will double the GPU memory usage, is not significant (0.434 -> 0.438) 3. ICoL is proposed to mitigate the insufficient memory on a single GPU and allow more neg- ative instances for better performance, but there are no corresponding experiments to show the influence of the number of negatives. As far as I know, the quality of negatives is more important than the quantity of negatives as shown in TAS-B. 4. It sounds unreasonable that increasing the model size can hurt the performance, as recent paper Ni et al. shows that the scaling law is also apply to dense retrieval model, so the preliminary experimental results on Wikipedia about model size should be provided in detail. \n5. Thepaperarguethattheproposedapproachistocomplementlexicalmatchingwithsemantic matching, while the training procedure of proposed model is totally independent with lexical matching. Therefore, the argument ”LEDR helps filter out such noise and allows the dense retriever to focus on fine-grained semantic matching” is confusing, because there is no suc- cession relationship between LEDR and dense retriever.\nReference: * Ni et al. 2021. https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07899 ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "the proposed LaPraDoR achieves relative low performance on MS-MARCO while relative high per- formance on BEIR, the inductive bias of the proposed pretrain method is worth exploring. \nLine 300-304: q and d are confusing ", "ethical_concerns": "N/A "}, "scores": {"overall": "2.5 ", "best_paper": "No", "replicability": "2 = They would be hard pressed to reproduce the results: The contribution depends on data that are simply not available outside the author's institution or consortium and/or not enough details are provided.", "datasets": "1 = No usable datasets submitted.", "software": "1 = No usable software released."}, "meta": {"license": "Copyright © 2021 administered by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)\n                                on behalf of ACL content contributors: Qiaoqiao She, and other contributors who wish to remain anonymous.\n                                Content is made available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.", "author_identity_guess": "1 = I do not have even an educated guess about author identity.", "confidence": "4 = Quite sure.

This hybrid approach has been shown effective in several previous works, e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00181 or https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13969.pdf (and many more) - It would be interesting to get the results for other dense + BM25 combinations. The dense retriever appears to be not the strongest (cf. Table 3, col. w/o LEDR), i.e. it is weaker than TAS-B (0.396 vs 0.415). So what would be the results of TAS-B+LEDR?\n**Pre-training approach** - A large contribution of the author is the proposal of a new pre-training approach that combines ICT + SimCSE with a large negative cache (ICoL) - Table 3 shows an improvement for the sole dense retrieval model if pre-training is used (e.g. w/o LEDR vs. w/O LEDR & PT) - However, we know that BERT is undertrained (see RoBERTa paper) and performing more pre-training steps yields an improvemed BERT model - A comparison against other pre-training approaches would have been interesting. What happens when I train e.g. with MLM for the same amount of compute on C4 and then do fine-tuning? What about other pre-training methods for dense retrievers (for an overview see https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07577)? Is the proposed pre-training method actually better than other pre-training strategies?\nI think the 3 additions (pre-training, ICoL, hybrid retrieval with BM25) could be better separated / evaluated more individually. It would help to see what are the contributing factors for the improved performance. So far it appears that switching to a hybrid approach with BM25 made the large difference in performance.\nHaving a more clear separation in their evaluation would help to assess what is really relevant for future methods.

Did you use some special off-loading?\n- Maybe I might missed it in the paper: Did you specify your max sequence length for pre-training / fine-tuning? I.e. do you use 512 word pieces or do you pre-train on shorter paragraphs?  - Table 4: The heading \"w/o ICT (SimCSE 2021c)\" looks confusing, you would think that ICT was proposed by SimCSE 2021c) - Table 4: Adding SimCSE to pre-training appears to bring little effect, performance improves from 43.4 -> 43.8. Could this improvement just be due to randomness? How does the performance change for the fine-tuning setting when pre-training was without SimCSE (i.e. just ICT pre-training followed by supervised MS MARCO training)?  - Table 5: The three settings, I assume these are the hybrid approaches with BM25.
