The data is thoroughly described and analysed, and a series of experiments are carried out comparing a range of baselines to a system based on Transformers. The paper presents the results from a particular configuration, while the appendix gives more details of the parameter space and other settings that were explored. A human evaluation was also carried out, which indicated that the proposed method produced output that was rated more highly than the baseline systems. The authors intend to release the data and code when the paper is published. ", "summary_of_strengths": "The main strength of this paper is the quality of the dataset, which is of a good size and appears to have high-quality, reliable annotations. This dataset, together with the code for the baseline and Transformer-based systems, can provide an extremely useful resource for other researchers working in this and similar areas.\nThe paper itself is well written throughout, and the inclusion of the appendix giving details of the other settings that were explored is a useful extra.

The authors evaluate whether the model assigns bigger attention weights to the appropriate control token when generating relevant sentences. However, they only show a single sample as an illustration. Such a single sample illustration is very vulnerable to cherry-picking and biases. Moreover, interpreting bigger attention weights as being more important is somewhat controversial in the field. It would be more helpful to the readers if the authors show diverse quantitative analyses.\n- The authors show how different control sequences affect the generated outputs with only 3 examples, which is extremely limited to see whether the model can be controlled.
