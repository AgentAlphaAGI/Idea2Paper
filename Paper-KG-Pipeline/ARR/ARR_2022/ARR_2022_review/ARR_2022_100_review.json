Models: The authors experimentally compare text-only BERT-base and a range of existing cross-modal models, pretrained with the different objectives, as far as applicable.   Experiments are conducted on 5 downstream tasks (PIQA, Visual Paraphrasing, OBQA, Metaphora on RiddleSense). In both, the low-resource and fully supervised setting, using contrastive learning (CL) seems to be the only beneficial cross-modal pre-training method (ii) applied for the visual-linguistic models (and only with additional sampling strategies in the case of pre-training on *image*-caption pairs)---these models slightly improve over the cross-modal baseline models (MLM) as well as the text-based LM (BERT).  The authors further demonstrate that for general language understanding (GLUE benchmark), the visual-linguistic models overall are less effective than text-only BERT.

That visual information, from captions or images, together with contrastive learning, is slightly beneficial for downstream tasks underlying visual commonsense? I am  missing insights into       - why the other pretraining strategies fail           - why there is, overall, basically no difference in performance between pre-training on captions or on images (shouldn't the latter even be more informative than captions?) \n         - why pre-training on visual-linguistic data is harmful for general NLU instead of just not beneficial. \n     - It is positive that such a range of different visual-linguistic models have been examined. However, from their descriptions in Section 3 I am not sure I can assess whether these models are fairly comparable.  - Text-based comparison baseline: BERT-base is a weak model compared to BERT-large or RoBERTa -- would the conclusion that visual information can be integrated and leads to better commonsense reasoning behaviour hold when these stronger purely text-based LMs were used?
