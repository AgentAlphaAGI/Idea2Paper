The authors provide the performance improvement of the proposed approach on the OOV dataset but do not show how the performances on the NER datasets change (if they). \n2.

Specifically, the proposed approach contains two mutual information based training objectives: i) Information maximization between context and entity surface forms. 2) Superfluous information minimization, which entails minimizing task-non-specific information. Both these objectives are modeled after the information bottleneck principle in information theory science.\nThe paper leverages several experimental datasets and baselines and in the end demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed solution. ", "summary_of_strengths": "1) The additional of the information theoretic approach within the current state-of-the-art for NER extraction i.e. SpanNER architecture is not just creative but an elegant engineering solution. It seems to extend the state-of-the-art incrementally, while showing a nice understanding of addressing precisely some problems or information leakages that can help boost NER for OOV NER.\n2) The solution proposed tackles a relevant advancement of the NER problem in the NLP community specifically OOV NER.\n3) From this paper, one can gain new insights into the OOV NER problem in terms of both the problem itself and the solution.  4) One can also gain a surveyistic birds-eye-view on the state-of-the-art systems and available datasets for the task.\n5) The experiments while they could have been better structured/organized (see my comments in “Summary of Weaknesses”) are still informative, and offer sound and meaningful observations. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "1) I would have liked to have seen a better application domain motivation for why the OOV problem in NER is so important.  2) The paper has the following phrase explaining the problem that it wishes to address: “entail preventing the model from rote memorizing the entity names or exploiting biased cues via eliminating entity name information.” However, majority of the paper and indeed the method itself seems to then emphasis the following specific problem, i.e. “eliminating task-specific nuisances.” I think maybe the former line should then either be removed or somewhere it state whether it is a hypothesis of the authors that “eliminating task-specific nuisances” indeed means “preventing the model from rote memorizing the entity names or exploiting biased cues via eliminating entity name information.” Perhaps the authors would need another whole paper to analyze what “eliminating task-specific nuisances” w.r.t. the proposed approach precisely means. So I would not say this as a weakness of this paper. However, is the phrase “preventing the model from rote memorizing the entity names or exploiting biased cues via eliminating entity name information” is used, it would help the reader if a connection is made to the actual solution which is mostly referred to as “eliminating task-specific nuisances.”\n3) I also wonder if the authors would be willing to rephrase “nuisances” in “eliminating task-specific nuisances?” Maybe as “noise?”\n4) Table 4. Curious why the ablation results are not shown on the CONLL 2003 dataset even though the method seems to have a maximum impact on it? Further, the CONLL 2003 – OOV data in particular seems quite relevant in this experimental setting. Can the authors provide these results? Otherwise the empirical analysis would seem incomplete to me by missing a seeming very relevant detail.  5) Not a weakness of this work as such. But maybe as a suggestion for future work. Lin et al [1] described four categories of artificially simulating OOV scenarios in NER. An empirical analysis with the method proposed in this work over their dataset or at least a dataset using their OOV synthesis methodology would be very interesting to have particularly on this problem of OOV NER.\n6) The authors did not mention MINER code will be publicly released if the paper were accepted.\n---------------- References ---------------- [1] Lin, Hongyu, et al. \"A Rigorous Study on Named Entity Recognition: Can Fine-tuning Pretrained Model Lead to the Promised Land?.\" Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). 2020.
