First, they introduced in detail about the process of mining geographical location in the paper. Then, they analyzed the results from the following four aspects: Where is NLP research done? Where is NLP research presented? What are the environmental costs? What are the diversity benefits? Finally, they discussed about the carbon cost and diversity gain associated with conferences in the ACL Anthology. ", "summary_of_strengths": "The paper is well-organized and it's easy to follow.

I think it is a technical paper, not a research paper. For example, it did not give the model details and only present the technological process.\n3.
