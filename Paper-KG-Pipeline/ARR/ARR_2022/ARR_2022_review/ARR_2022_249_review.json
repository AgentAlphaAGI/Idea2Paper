The main idea proposed in this paper is to devise event-argument templates which are language agnostic and act as a bridge across across languages. Event argument extraction is then reduced to a slot filling task where the difference between languages lies in the different arguments. The model uses cross-lingual embeddings and treats slot filling as a sequence generation task.

There are no changes in the updated version that warrant a change in my score or the review. I’ve updated a summary of weaknesses to reflect the updates, and have listed a few suggestions on grammar.*\nThis work presents a method (X-GEAR) for zero-shot, cross-lingual event argument extraction. X-GEAR takes as input i) a passage, ii) a trigger word (a predicate, e.g., \"killed\"), and iii) a template indicating the desired roles (e.g., <Victim>NONE</Victim>). The output is the template filled with event arguments extracted from the passage (e.g., NONE might be replaced with civilian). X-GEAR is built using the standard Seq2seq framework with a copy mechanism, where the input is composed of the triplet (passage, template, trigger word) flattened as a sequence, and the output is the template filled with desired roles.\nThe method relies on recent advances in large, multilingual pre-trained language models (PTLM) such as MT5, which have been shown to perform robust cross-lingual reasoning. The key insight of the method is to use language-agnostic special tokens (e.g., <Victim>) for the template. Fine-tuning on the source language helps learn meaningful representations for templates, which allows their approach to work across target languages supported by the PTLM. ", "summary_of_strengths": "- The paper presents a simple but intuitive method for solving an important problem. The simplicity of the proposed method is a significant strength of this work. As the authors note, existing systems that perform structured extraction often rely on a pipeline of sub-modules. X-GEAR replaces that with a simple Seq2seq framework which is considerably easier to use and maintain.\n- The proposed method is clearly defined, the experiments are thorough and show considerable gains over the baselines.\n- The analysis provides several insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "The authors have addressed some of the weaknesses highlighted in the previous review. However, it would be great if the weakness of the proposed approach is also highlighted in the future version. Specifically, the method is not *truly* zero-shot as it can only work in cases where a PLTM for the target languages is available. I believe that this is an important point and should be highlighted in conclusion or related work.
