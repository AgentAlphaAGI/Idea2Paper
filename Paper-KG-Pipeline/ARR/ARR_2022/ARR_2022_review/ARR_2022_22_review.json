It uses the hyperlink structure in the Web documents to create pseudo question-passage pairs to train the retriever. The paper tests two approaches: (1) dual-link that extracts the question-passage pairs from two pages that link to each other, and (2) co-mention that extracts the pairs from two pages that link to a same page. It adopts a standard bi-encoder trained using the extracted question-passage pairs. Experiments are conducted using five standard question answering datasets under zero-shot, few-shot, multi-hop, and out-of-domain scenarios, and report enhanced empirical performance. ", "summary_of_strengths": "- Dataset creation method that is highly useful to train the retriever for open domain question answering - Enhanced retrieval performance in popular question answering benchmarks - Extensive experiments that validate the effectiveness of the proposed method - Well-written paper ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "The method significantly underperform BM25 in the MS MARCO dataset, which is one of the most popular retrieval benchmark. This suggests that the applicability of the proposed method to general QA domain is limited.
