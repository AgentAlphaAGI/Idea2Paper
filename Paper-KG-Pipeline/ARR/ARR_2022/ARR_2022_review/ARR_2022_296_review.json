", "summary_of_strengths": "This paper designs an event-specific template for generative event extraction. \nCompared with the previous methods, the proposed method is more consistent with natural language generation and achieves better performance in the low-resource setting. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "- The proposed framework is based on the previous template-based information extraction method. \nThe template-based method's main drawback is the significantly increased training/inference cost (corresponding to the number of event types). The increase in the category of events (such as MAVEN with 100+ types) will exacerbate the problem.\n- For extreme low-resource settings (1%), different data sampling may heavily affect the experimental results. \nIt is better to conduct experiments multi-times on different subset samples. ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "Some detailed questions about model inference: - Multi-events: Can DEGREE and DEGREE(ED) deal with multiple events of the same type in the same sentence? Although we can predict the same input sentence for different types one-by-one if a sentence contains multiple events of the same type, the same input (template and sentence) will correspond to various outputs. For example, some sentences have two death events. This is not a problem for other generation methods because they are trigger-driven (TANL, BART-GEN), or generate all extracted events in one step (Text2Event).\n- Converting generated results to events: Are there some generated results that cannot be parsed into events? Generation methods are more uncontrollable than span extraction and span classification methods for event extraction. For example, the generated span maybe not appear in the input sentence.\nThere are many template methods for information extraction. \nIt is suggested that authors should cite these articles: - Template-Based Named Entity Recognition Using BART.

", "summary_of_weaknesses": "My main concern is the limited Effect in real applications.  From the results in table 1, it seems like the proposed model is more likely to help when 5%-10% of training data are provided. ( By the way, it seems weird that OneIE will drop performance when 10% of the data is provided.) However, annotating that amount of data is also labor-intensive and hard to get for novel classes we might want to extract in the future.  Besides that, the used template seems to be a powerful prior knowledge. For example, as discussed in table 4, using the keywords only can lead to almost the same performance of the model. Can you provide more discussion on how many tested triggers are covered by the provided keywords? I suspect that there might be a big overlap.  Compared with using 10% of data, zero-shot is a more interesting and realistic data-scare setting. ( If we can afford to annotate some data, why not just annotate more). Unfortunately, experiments in the appendix do not compare with existing zero-shot approaches for the event extraction tasks [1, 2, 3] Last but not least, the high-quality template and keywords may not always be available in real applications. ( we actually need domain experts to design that). Is there a way to automatically generate those templates with minimum efforts (e.g., event type name)?\nDue to the limitation of ACE, which is highly biased (almost 40% of the test data is \"attack\"), maybe the results on a more diverse and balanced dataset [4] are more convincing.
