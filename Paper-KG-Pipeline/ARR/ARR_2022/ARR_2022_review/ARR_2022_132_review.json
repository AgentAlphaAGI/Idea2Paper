", "summary_of_strengths": "1) This paper proposes a novel challeging task of simple definition generation.\n2) The proposed style transfer approach using parameter sharing outperforms strong pipeline approaches.

Decoder are evaluated on Complex (from the OD test set) and simple definitions from Rec. Decoder are evaluated on Simple (from the OALD test set).\n6) The expression of \"fully unsupervised\" in Section 1 is a bit misleading, because an alternative standard dictionary containing complex definitions can be used for training.\n7) Conducting multiple runs with different seeds is preferable.
