The authors take the now-common, end-to-end neural network perspective in training a model to tag references but specifically contributing a model for citation-driven citation fragments. The authors decompose the task as three joint tasks of discourse tagging, citation span detection and citation type recognition. The authors also discuss a human in the loop (HITL) environment for accomplishing such work, based on their incremental, correction-based annotation of a trained transformer model in their annotation loop.\n(This is a v2 submission and since the paper hasn't substantially changed, I've left the summary the same as in v1) ", "summary_of_strengths": "-  Well written and edited. I did not find much issues with the English use and the paper reads fluently.\n- Propose a new taxonomy of related work sentences (S3.1.1).\n-  Surprisingly high interannotator agreement, albeit with just two annotators. However, it is not clear whether the annotators are part of the authoring team and this should be disclosed on first mention.   - Finding that reference vs dominant citation types differ in their citation span lengths and strategies to generate, and contributing the longformer-encoder-decoder model towards appropriate modeling of this goal. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "- Citation type recognition is limited to two types –– dominant and reference –– which belies the complexity of the citation function, which is a significant line of research by other scholars. However this is more of a choice of the research team in limiting the scope of research.\n- Relies on supplemental space to contain the paper.  The paper is not truly independent given this problem (esp. S3.1 reference to Sup. Fig. 6) and again later as noted with the model comparison and other details of the span vs. sentence investigation.\n- The previous report of SciBERT were removed, but this somewhat exacerbates the earlier problem in v1 where the analyses of the outcomes of the models was too cursory and unsupported by deeper analyses.  However, this isn't very fair to write as a weakness because the current paper just simply doesn't mention this.\n- Only having two annotators for the dataset is a weakness, since it's not clear how the claims might generalise, given such a small sample.\n- A summative demographics is inferrable but not mentioned in the text.  Table 1's revised caption mentions 2.9K paragraphs as the size.

I understand you want to preserve space to make up for the new additions into your manuscript, but the wider margins would help for legibility.\nMinor changes were made S3.3 to incorporate more connection to prior work.  S4.1 Model design was elaborated into subsections, S5.2.1 adds an introduction to LED.\n462 RoBERTa-base ", "ethical_concerns": "None.
