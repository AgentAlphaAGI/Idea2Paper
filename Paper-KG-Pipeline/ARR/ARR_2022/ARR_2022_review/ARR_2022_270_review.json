This work attempts to demonstrate that privacy concerns exist by a simple attacker network that identifies persona attributes and proposes defense objectives that reduce the exploitation of the model's hidden state. With learning objectives that minimize mutual information and reduce over-learning, this work demonstrates that defense objectives satisfactorily defend against the proposed attacker network.\nProblem Large language models are ubiquitous in application and particularly useful when constructing chatbots. Figure 1 shows that the learned representations of utterance can manifest sensitive information about the persona. The authors also show that with no access to the model, just the final sequence hidden state, simple attacker architectures (MLP) can infer personas from utterances with 37.59% accuracy over 4332 personas. In order to address this, the authors propose two additional learning objectives with an adversarial attacker network. From the perspective of social chatbots, no existing chatbot dataset for private persona information exists. The authors contribute a derivative dataset from PersonaChat that aligns private attributes to the respective personas.\nTheir contributions are as follows - Analyzing persona identification and understanding as a privacy risk - Defensive training loss - Experiments that validate the defense and shows no informativity loss i.e downstream capabilities.\nNote, the defense is across the utterance embeddings which are inherently richer than output token sequences. A defense on sequence embeddings, i.e contextual embeddings in GPT, should constitute effective defense at the token sequence level.\nThe authors use a pre-trained version of GPT-2, DialogGPT, as the initial set of model weights and fine-tune DialogGPT with the PersonaChat dataset. The authors fine-tune their model with three combined losses: Language modeling CE loss, KL loss over the persona distribution predicted by the attacker, and a MI adversarial loss that learns to maximize the attackers classification accuracy which in turn forces the model to incur a defense loss. The KL loss seems to flatten the over-learning problem in CE fine-tuning and the MI loss makes the network private by leveraging a MLP to remove statistical co-occurences in the embeddings related to personas. The overall loss is computed as a weighted sum.\nExperiments The authors gather a persona aligned utterance dataset from Dialogue NLI and PersonaChat. They train a 2 layer MLP attacker model using the sequence embedding as input. The metrics used to evaluate their model is Bayesian Privacy, Bert-score, Top-k, BLEU, PPL, and Distinct.\nTables Table 2 illustrates that traditional LM has a glaring over-learning issue that captures the personas of speakers. This reaffirms the authors motivations. Best guess and random are anticipated to be quite low. The KL portion of the loss in LM+KL variants show that the accuracy is decreased by the regularization effect of the KL loss which is quantified by the max-ratio score (the ratio of most predicted to all predictions). We see that MI adversarial loss forces the model to change output so that the MLP cannot guess persona attributes (reduces accuracy), but does so by making the optimal performance similar to the best guess in that the max ratio jumps significantly and predominately predicts a few persona attributes (my favorite color is blue). The LM+MI variants are likely sufficiently private from my understanding, but reveals attributes/personas that are not relevant; this is of concern in smaller persona datasets. The authors point this out which is very important i.e can fixing privacy open other threat surfaces for other persona applications. This problem emphasizes why KL loss is particularly useful. The authors show that the best model is one that achieves low accuracy on the person prediction task and achieves, secondly, the lowest max-ratio score.\nTable 3 Shows that the scores across a variety of metrics are relatively unchanged for the defensed models to the original LM. We see an increase in PPL indicating that the CE encoding requires more bits but with no change to performance metrics. The PPL increase was explained by the authors as possibly stemming from the noisy nature of the KL loss with respect to the persona predictors task; the attacker model does not want a uniform model. The authors additionally use BERTScore to evaluate the similarity in embedding space, BLEU to check similarity of unigram and bigrams, and Dist to check the distinct unigram and bigrams.  Table 4 shows that the performance across unseen persona labels. This is an important evaluation because the training defense mechanism is significantly more useful if it does not require all personas present for training. We see that performance is pretty similar even when the defender is not allowed to see some of the personas. The subset of personas that are unseen are still significantly below the original language model. From my intuition, this means that the defense objective robustly defends against the attacker model regardless of persona. This invites a conversation about increasingly capable attackers.\nFinally the authors conclude with a qualitative probe of persona predictions and visually demonstrate the output we see in high max-ratio scores; the repetition of the a particular persona/attribute \"my favorite color is blue\". This is intriguing because it shows that the attacking model has focused on some features that lead to an (sub)-optimal result, namely, \"my favorite color is blue\" persona/attribute. This result shows that the attacking model is no longer capable of probing the embeddings; however a more complex model might still be able to represent the GPT-2 parameterized defensed embeddings.\nIn summary it appears that the defense strategies work with little affect to the evaluated metrics. Various downstream applications of the defensed embeddings with compatible performance to traditional LM embeddings would concretely prove that there is little utility degradation, thus expanding on the evaluated metrics; this is largely out of the scope of the paper but would solidify its results. Additionally, expanding the attacker model to more complex neural networks is a worthwhile practical application for the proposed loss functions.
