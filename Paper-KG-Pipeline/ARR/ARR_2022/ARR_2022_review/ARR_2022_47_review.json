The overall CL loss comprises of three losses. First, the (Multihead) Instance-centered contrastive loss that aims to bring the instance embedding closer to the label embedding by anchoring on the instance and its label as positive example and instance-other labels as negative examples. Second, the label centered contrastive loss which uses labels to mine positive and negative labels from a batch. And finally, to promote better uniformity across learned embeddings - label embeddings are also regularized.  The authors conduct experiments on standard benchmark NLP tasks showing that their approach produces better/competitive results to baselines. They also show the effectiveness of their approach in Few Shot and Data imbalance settings.  Ablation study provides the importance of each of the component / architectural choices. ", "summary_of_strengths": "1. Well written, well reasoned, easy to follow how model / architecture / experiments are setup up. \n2. Extensive experimentation / ablation with statistical significant testing. \n3. Effective use of label semantics in Supervised Contrastive Learning. \n4. The work seems well researched given their knowledge of CL field which is showcased not only in related work section but also the mention of alignment/uniformity, preventing degradation in CL models, regularizing label embeddings etc. From a CL modeling perspective - the authors have crossed all the \"t\"s dotted all the \"i\"s. \n5. Results show improvements / competitiveness across standard benchmarks and their technique is easy to implement / replicate. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "1. While the paper details a lot of \"How\"s - the \"Why\"s are missing from their design choices. E.g. why do they think the label semantics arent explored enough (line 70-72), what motivated the use of multi-head instance CL loss (135-137), why the need for a 3 layer projection head g (line 187-194).  Research papers should address the why if they wish the community to learn and extend their lessons.\n2. The author mention uniformity / alignment which is win in and off itself but they do not present any results based on these metrics (e.g. in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08821.pdf)  3. Why do the authors use regularization for label embeddings but not for instance embeddings? Given that the goal is improving uniformity - they should have at least considered using (spread out) regularization for instance embeddings too (ref: eq 6 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06320.pdf) ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "1. The claim they make in lines 225-228 are partially true. The equation aids in aligning instance with label embeddings but it does not contain any elements that encourages different instances to disperse. Such dispersion is only encouraged by considering hinge losses or using spread out regularization (e.g. by equation 6 in this paper). As such the claim of uniformity should be removed from lines 225-228.  2.

However, the authors do not explain the reason behind their counter-intuitive change nor provide an ablation study on this modification. I would like to see the justification of this change and experimental results that support it.\n- In subsection 2.6, the authors introduce LaCon with label fusion which requires additional computation compared to LaCon-vanilla and CE baseline. It would be better if the authors can quantify the computation overhead by providing the inference time of the methods.\n- The Instance-centered Contrastive Loss (ICL) is not very novel given that it is just a different view of the softmax classifier. By treating the weights of the last linear layer as the embedding vectors of each class, optimizing the cross-entropy is almost identical to ICL (except that the vectors should be L2 normalized which is basically applying weight normalization to the last linear layer and normalize the features right before the last layer).

The proposed loss is similar to both NCE and InfoNCE, so changing either the citation or name of the method is fine. The same error also appears in line 94.\n- The proposed method lies in the metric learning field; however, the authors do mention the related metric learning work in their section 5 (related work). For example, the contrastive loss was first proposed by Chopra et al. (2005) and triplet loss (Weinberger et al., 2005; Schroff et al., 2015) is also quite relevant to this paper.\n- It would be great if we can see that the proposed method works for other pretrained models besides BERT as well.\nReferences - Oord, Aäron van den et al. “Representation Learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding.” ArXiv abs/1807.03748 (2018): n. pag.\n- Chopra, Sumit, Raia Hadsell, and Yann LeCun. \" Learning a similarity metric discriminatively, with application to face verification.\" 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05).
