This paper raises the issues, surveys existing strategies, and highlights directions for the future development of cross-cultural NLP. \n+ When discussing the four cultural factors, the authors cite the various examples from different culture around the world (not Western centric only). For example: Latin America, Middle East (section 2); India (section 4); and Africa (section 6).    + Most recommendations, regarding data curation, annotation, translation, and model bulding, are sensible and formulated in systematic way.

I enjoyed reading it, especially for the attempt of brining awareness on cultural issues, which are often neglected in current NLP practices. I think the authors did a very extensive and comprehensive work on the bibliography, which could be useful for correcting biases.\nOn the other hand, I feel that is often difficult to disentangle between linguistic and cultural dimension, and in many cases  the problems/solutions are overlapping with the typical low-resource language scenarios (e.g. where a particular language/dialect/sociolect can be associated with a specific cultural group), and in such cases the general heuristic could be described as \"the more cultural-specific data we can acquire, the better\"; while in other cases it is difficult to propose any conclusive solution (e.g. see the case for model training in Section 6.2, where methods balancing for bias would require access to demographic attributes, but the problem would persist because one cannot really be sure that such attributes adequately reflect culture).  I guess this is a general problematic when one has to deal with something like culture, which is notoriously difficult to define. \nAt the end of my reading, I still feel that I did not get what are, specifically, the directions indicated by the authors (this might well be a limitation of mine) ...
