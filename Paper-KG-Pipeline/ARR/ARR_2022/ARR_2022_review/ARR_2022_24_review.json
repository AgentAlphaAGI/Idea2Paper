It uses similar synthetic data to this prior work, but adds a dependency dataset. This dependency dataset is similar to the parenthetical dataset that exists, but it uses different symbols for opening and closing, rather than the same symbol. Their results are mostly similar to the existing results, but they find that introducing different opening and closing symbols does make the nested structure important for transfer, which is different from the previous results.  They then go over results after pretraining on masked language model objectives and then fine tuning on dependency parsing. ", "summary_of_strengths": "I was very interested in the result that a simple and well-justified modification to the parenthetical language actually reveals nested structure to be valuable.\nThey run multiple seeds for the pretraining objective, allowing them to perform statistical tests over pretrained parameters.

Do they mean that the prior work was using multiple sentences as input at a time and they are using shorter inputs? And if so, does this actually generalize to a more typical setting, which uses fixed length multiple sentence inputs? If you are making a significant change, justifying it verbally is not as good as testing the effect of it.\nThe authors describe the Transformer performance as evidence that \"Transformer encoders exhibit surprisingly good transferability to other languages\". I disagree with this characterization. It looks from the plot as though the random weights have much better performance in the Transformer model, indicating that the Transformer is not necessarily transferring the data better, but is just better at learning the fine tuned task generally.

Based on the assumption that the LM encoder is able to learn language-agnostic knowledge during a transfer, the authors construct a synthesized language with different linguistic features to probe for. Notably, the authors are interested in two features. The first is word distribution, for which a uniform distribution, a NL-like distribution based on Zipf's law, and another with word co-occurrences are considered. The second is dependency structure, for which a head-to-tail token grouping method is used.  During evaluation, the paper pre-trains LMs with causal language modeling objective on the synthesized languages and evaluate its perplexity on natural language data, and reaches a series of interesting observations about LSTM and Transformer on these languages with different linguistic features. For LMs with masked language modeling objective, downstream tasks such as POS tagging and dependency parsing are also considered.  The main takeaway is that LMs benefit the most from a nested structure from the synthesized language, with an especially strong downstream performance. ", "summary_of_strengths": "- The paper tackles the fascinating question of how LMs are able to transfer cross-lingually. Specifically, readers like myself who are aware that LMs _can_ transfer from L1 to L2 without the same alphabets, are interested in knowing _how_.  - The proposed approach of using a synthesized language as L1 is creative and reasonable. While the idea stems from (Papadimitriou and and Jurafsky, 2020), I still applaud the novelty, especially with a suite of improvements and additions to the method.  - The experiments seem sound.  - The observations are informed and faithful to the results, and are clearly presented.  - The paper is very well written. For a reader who is no expert on such line of probing work, it is very easy to follow. ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "- In Section 3.2.3, I struggle to understand the intuition and motivation behind the head-to-tail method. How does the fact that two tokens (i.e. \"<xyz\" and \"xyz>\") always appear in the same sentence help create a dependency relation? While the method seems to stem from Papadimitriou and Jurafsky (2020), it's desirable to explain a bit more for self-containment.  - In Section 3.2.2, I would appreciate more intuition behind the \"Random walk\" language. Mathematically (for someone who is not an expert on linear algebra), why would the dot product between a \"topic vector\" and a \"word vector\" give rise to \"non-trivial cooccurrence\"?  - I'd like to know why the authors perform different experiments on language models with CLM (causal) and MLM (masked) objectives. Specifically, why not also calculate perplexity of an MLM encoder on an NL L2? Why not also run the CLM encoder on some downstream tasks?  - For the CLM experiments, is it widely believed that perplexity is a faithful metric to evaluate \"performance\" of the encoder in question?\n- In Section 5.2, it's confusing to choose POS tagging as a downstream task, and then neglect it in the analysis because \"PoS tagging seems to require little structural knowledge on language\". I would appreciate a bit more discussion here. Does the linguistic features studied help with POS, or not? What is the purpose of reporting the POS experiment?\n- Circling back to the motivation of this work, which is the fact that \"an encoder only pretrained on L1 can be transferred to L2 without any parameter updates\". I wonder in what downstream tasks the said encoder transferred to? Are there any higher-level tasks such as NLI, QA, SRL, etc.? Would you consider other downstream tasks than dependency parsing?
