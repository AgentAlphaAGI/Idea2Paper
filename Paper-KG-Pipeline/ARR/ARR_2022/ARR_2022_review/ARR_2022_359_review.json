For input speech or text, the modal-specific pre-net processes it into a shared space. Then the shared encoder-decoder network performs the sequence-to-sequence conversion. Finally, the modal-specific post-nets generate the corresponding output. For learning cross-modal alignment, a vector quantization method is proposed. Experiments on several spoken language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. ", "summary_of_strengths": "1. \tThis paper proposes a new framework, which treats various spoken language processing tasks as a unified format. With the help of the task-specific pre/post-nets, the encoder-decoder network is shared across all tasks. This makes the efficient training. \n2. \tThis paper proposes a vector quantized method for cross-modal alignment. This technique may inspire related studies about cross-modal learning. \n3. \tThe proposed SpeechT5 achieves multiply state-of-the-art results on spoken language processing tasks.

The joint learning are said to improve the performance of downstream tasks. While evaluated on a variety of speech related tasks, SpeechT5 demonstrates impressive performance compared to other pretrained models (Wav2Vec2 & HuBERT).   This paper contains non-trivial contributions. As the authors noted, this is the first model that try to combine speech recognition and generation tasks in speech pre-training. This alone will be an important contribution to the field of speech processing, as previous pretrained models like Wav2Vec2 & HuBERT models do not focus on speech generation tasks. This could be a step towards uniting the pipeline of speech processing.

", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "- Vased on what is written in this paper, it seems that the authors do not state any plans to release the code and the pre-trained weights. SpeechT5 is a complex model with several pretraining tasks and ultilizes a lot of computing resources. It might not be easy to replicate the model for a significant number of researchers. If the authors can consider releasing the model, it will benefit more of the research community.  - As speech and texts are projected into the same latent space, it will be interesting to see an analysis of the joint embedding space to better understand how the model learns.
