Prix-LM is trained via a casual LM objective, utilizing monolingual knowledge triples and cross-lingual links. It embeds knowledge from the KB in different languages into a shared representation space, which benefits transferring complementary knowledge between languages. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Prix-LM for automatic KB construction in multilingual setups. ", "summary_of_strengths": "1.

The authors evaluate Prix-LM model on four different tasks essential for automatic KB construction, covering both high-resource and low-resource languages.

The pre-trained language models can thus serve knowledge base construction tasks such as link prediction (LP), (cross-lingual) entity linking (XEL), bilingual lexicon induction (BLI), and prompt-based knowledge probing (LM-KP).  For inference, the authors propose two types of inferences; one as autoregressive inference that makes the LM generate objects to complete KB tuplets using constrained beam search, and the other as similarity-based inference that generates similarity-comparable embeddings using a contrastive learning method (Mirror-BERT).  They evaluated the proposed approach on the aforementioned downstream tasks. For the LP task, they evaluated on the DBpedia and achieved the best performance on Hits@1 across all languages compared to baseline models (TransE, ComplEx, and RotatE). For the XEL task, they evaluated on the UMLS and outperformed baselines  (XLM-R and mBERT, both with contrastive learning) in most languages. For the BIL task, they evaluated on the VecMap and outperformed baselines (XLM-R + Mirror). For the LM-KP task, they evaluated on the mLAMA benchmark.  Based on the experimental results, they conclude that the proposed approach can leverage pre-training on multilingual knowledge bases to learn better representations for downstream knowledge base construction tasks.\nOther comments are addressed below respectively. ", "summary_of_strengths": "Based on the experiments, the paper demonstrates that using the surface form of knowledge tuples with special control tokens to pre-train language models can enable the LMs to learn better representations for entities and their relations. Several analyses in the paper might benefit the community for tackling pre-training scheme designs, such as how representations would differ w.r.t. different stages during the training (sec 3.6). ", "summary_of_weaknesses": "- Using original encoders as baselines might not be sufficient. In most experiments, the paper only compares with the original XLM-R or mBERT trained without any knowledge base information. It is unclear whether such encoders being fine-tuned towards the KB tasks would actually perform comparable to the proposed approach. I would like to see experiments like just fine tuning the encoders with the same dataset but the MLM objective in their original pretraining and comparing with them. Such baselines can leverage on input sequences as simple as `<s>X_s X_p X_o </s>` where one of them is masked w.r.t. MLM training.\n- The design of input formats is intuitive and lacks justifications. Although the input formats for monolingual and cross-lingual links are designed to be consistent, it is hard to tell why the design would be chosen. As the major contribution of the paper, justifying the design choice matters. In other words, it would be better to see some comparisons over some variants, say something like `<s>[S]X_s[S][P]X_p[P][O]X_o[O]</s>` as wrapping tokens in the input sequence has been widely used in the community. ", "comments,_suggestions_and_typos": "- The abstract part is lengthy so some background and comparisons with prior work can be elaborated in the introduction and related work. Otherwise, they shift perspective of the abstract, making it hard for the audience to catch the main novelties and contributions.\n- In line 122, triples denoted as $(e_1, r, e_2)$ would clearly show its tuple-like structure instead of sets.\n- In sec 3.2, the authors argue that the Prix-LM (All) model consistently outperforms the single model, hence the ability of leveraging multilingual information. Given the training data sizes differ a lot, I would like to see an ablation that the model is trained on a mix of multilingual data with the same overall dataset size as the monolingual. Otherwise, it is hard to justify whether the performance gain is from the large dataset or from the multilingual training.
