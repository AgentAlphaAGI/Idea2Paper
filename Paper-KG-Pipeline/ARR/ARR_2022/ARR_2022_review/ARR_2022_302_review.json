Moreover, active learning is used across all training languages based on low confidence criteria.  The tasks addressed are tagging, NER, and dependency parsing. experiments are done on English, Spanish, Japanese, German and Dutch.\nThe paper seems to presume that zero-shot transfer of individual monolingual models has been the only method of choice when tackling multilingual tasks. However, there is a sizable body of work that aims solely on producing a single model for various languages, seeking to reduce the number of parameters while retaining performance. Here are some examples: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/473803f0f2ebd77d83ee60daaa61f381-Paper.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01595.pdf ", "summary_of_strengths": "A fair comparison between various mono and multilingual setups and active learning regimen.
