      "text" : "How come people disagree on the best course forward in controversial issues, even if they use the same information to form their opinion? A way to get to the bottom of such disagreement is to repeatedly ask them why they see something as desirable. We observe that people have different beliefs and priorities of what is generally worth striving for (e.g., personal achievements vs. humility) and how to do so (e.g., being self-directed vs. respecting traditions), often referred to as (human) values (Searle, 2003). Some values tend to conflict and others to align (cf. Figure 1), which can cause disagreement on the best course forward, but also the support, if not formation, of political parties that promote the respective highly revered values. Moreover, one can observe different value priorities between cultures and disagreement thereon.\nDue to their outlined importance, human values are studied both in the social sciences (Schwartz, 1994) and formal argumentation (Bench-Capon, 2003) since decades. According to the former,"

      "text" : "a “value is a (1) belief (2) pertaining to desirable end states or modes of conduct, that (3) transcends specific situations, (4) guides selection or evaluation of behavior, people, and events, and (5) is ordered by importance relative to other values to form a system of value priorities.” Consider the following example:\n“Social media is good for us. Though it might make people less polite, it makes our lives much easier.”\nTo understand the pragmatics of this statement, a reader has to acknowledge the belief (Point 1 in the definition above) that the “end state” (2) of having a comfortable life is desirable in general (3). To concur with the statement (4), the reader further has to prefer having a comfortable life over being polite (5). Within computational linguistics, human\nvalues thus provide the context to categorize, compare, and evaluate argumentative statements, creating several possibilities: to inform social science research on values through large-scale datasets; to assess argumentations with respect to scope and strength; and to generate or select arguments based on the value system of a target audience.\nHowever, the task to identify values in arguments seems daunting due to their large number, often implicit use in arguments, and vague definitions. On the other hand, the creation of larger argumentation datasets, advancements in natural language understanding, and the decade-long rigorous taxonomization of values by social scientists has put such an automatic identification within reach.\nAs a first endeavour on the automatic identification of values in written arguments, this paper makes three contributions: (1) a consolidated multilevel taxonomy of 54 human values taken from four authoritative cross-cultural social science studies (Section 3); (2) a dataset of 5270 arguments from the US (most arguments), Africa, China, and India, each of which manually annotated for all values by three annotators, corresponding to about 850k human judgments (Section 4); and (3) first classification results per taxonomy level, establishing a baseline and revealing promising results both within and across cultures (Section 5)."

      "text" : "Human values are of concern to most if not to all social sciences (Rokeach, 1973) and have also been integrated into computational frameworks of argumentation (Bench-Capon, 2003). In NLP, values have been analyzed for personality profiling (Maheshwari et al., 2017), but not yet for argument mining, as considered here."

      "heading" : "2.1 Values in Social Science",
      "text" : "Rokeach (1973) already described the two concepts of (1) a value as a belief pertaining to desirable end states or modes of conduct and (2) a value system as prioritization of values based on cultural, social, and personal factors. These definitions attribute values to persons rather than to objects, facilitating a systematic analysis (Rokeach, 1973). The paper at hand targets the personal values behind arguments, meaning the values in the former sense that the arguments, mostly implicitly, resort to.\nSeveral of the value schemes proposed in the literature pertain to specific purposes. England (1967)\nsuggested 66 values related to management decisions, such as high productivity and prestige, and categorized them by relevant entity, for example business organizations and individuals. Brown and Crace (2002) looked at 14 values for counseling and therapy, such as responsibility and spirituality, and Kahle et al. (1988) at nine for consumer research, such as warm relationships and excitement.\nOther proposed value schemes are more generic. Combining research from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and psychology, Rokeach (1973) estimates the total number of human values to be fewer than hundreds, and develops a practical survey of 36 values that distinguishes between values pertaining to desirable end states and desirable behavior. Specifically for cross-cultural analyses, Schwartz et al. (2012) derived 48 value questions from the universal needs of individuals and societies, including obeying all the laws and to be humble. Moreover, Schwartz (1994) proposes a relatedness of values by their tendency to be compatible in their pursuit (see Figure 1). This relatedness reflects two “higher order” conflicts: (1) openness to change/own thoughts vs. conservation/submission, and (2) self-transcension (directed towards others/the environment) vs. self-enhancing (directed towards one’s self), allowing to analyse values at several levels. Cheng and Fleischmann (2010) consolidates 12 schemes into a “meta-inventory” with 16 values, such as honesty and justice, revealing a large overlap in schemes across fields of research. However, as the meta-inventory is strictly more coarse-grained than Schwartz et al.’s theory we do not investigate it further for this paper."

      "text" : "Formal argumentation employs value systems to model audience-specific preferences, that is, an argument’s strength depends on the degree to which the audience reveres the values the argument resorts to. Examples include value-based argumentation schemes (van der Weide et al., 2009), defeasible logic programming (Teze et al., 2019), and the value-based argumentation framework of BenchCapon (2003). The latter is an extension of the abstract argumentation framework of Dung (1995) that has already been applied manually to analyze interactions with reasoning and persuasion subject to a specific value system (Atkinson and BenchCapon, 2021). This paper present a first step towards the large-scale automatic application of these\nworks as it takes values to argument mining. Feldman (2021) recently showed the strong connection between values and the moral foundation theory (Haidt, 2012). Like personal values, this theory analyzes ethical reasoning behind human choices, but considers five rather abstract “foundations:” care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. Alshomary and Wachsmuth (2021) hypothesized that the foundations could be used for audiencespecific argument generation. Kobbe et al. (2020) tried to classify arguments by foundations, but noted a low human agreement due to the vagueness of the foundations. We assume values can here contribute to the classification by foundations.\nPartly, values overlap with ideas of framing in communication, that is, the selection and emphasis of specific aspects of (perceived) reality to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, ethical evaluation, and/or recommendation (Entman, 1993). In frames, values can define the costs and benefits of options (Entman, 1993) whereas common value systems are used for evaluation. Frames have been studied computationally for news (Naderi and Hirst, 2015), political speech (De Vreese, 2005), and argumentation (Ajjour et al., 2019). In argumentation, some values are so prevalent that they constitute frames of their own, indicating a potential use of values in frame identification. For example, 14 of the 54 values we use in this work are also frames in the dataset of Ajjour et al.1\nValues may be considered as aspects under which to group arguments. Some researchers have mined aspects from text (Trautmann, 2020) or used them to control argument generation (Schiller et al., 2021). Others have studied the task of opinion summarization in arguments (Egan et al., 2016; Misra et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2019), aiming at the most important aspects discussed in a debate. Related, the task of key point analysis (Bar-Haim et al., 2020; Friedman et al., 2021) is to generate a small set of concise statements that each represent a different aspect. We argue that analyzing the values found in a collection of arguments provides a new perspective to aspects in argumentation, focusing on the “why” behind an argument’s reasoning."

      "heading" : "3 Taking Values to Argument Mining",
      "text" : "Human values have been considered in formal argumentation since about 20 years (Bench-Capon, 2003). However, to the best of our knowledge,\n1Per Jaccard similarity of value and frame names ≥ 0.5.\nour paper is the first that aims to identify values behind arguments computationally. The term “behind” reflects the fact that many arguments do not explicate values; e.g., in the argument “no matter they felt forced to commit it: anyone who commits a crime should be prosecuted” no value is mentioned literally. The argument gains its persuasive strength when being connected to values, which can be both desirable behavior (behaving properly) or end states (a safe country). By putting forward an argument, its proponent wants the audience to connect the argument with its values. The task at hand is to draw this connection automatically.\nThe heart of a value-based argumentation framework is a value taxonomy (or a set of values) that is both accepted and relevant. The research presented in this paper is largely based on the refined theory of Schwartz et al. (2012),2 which, however, has been extended by us: A comparison of Schwartz’s refined theory with three other widespread value lists against a sample of our dataset lead to the addition and integration of nine values (cf. Table 1). We also asked the annotators to comment on supposedly missing values (cf. Section 4). For most of the additional 48 value descriptions that we received (be humane, be fair, be modern, etc.) we were able to identify in the proposed taxonomy existing values or value combinations that subsume them, suggesting to extend the value descriptions rather than adding new values. Only two of the added values are not directly related to the universal needs where Schwartz (1994) based the value categories on. The proposed category universalism: objectivity integrates well between the outward thinking of universalism: tolerance and the free thinking of self-direction: thought (see Figure 1). We adopt a uniform naming scheme where the value names reflect the distinction of Rokeach (1973) into instrumental (be . . . ) and terminal (have . . . ) values, that can be easily embedded in sentences, for example, “it is good to be creative.”\nThe close connection of our taxonomy to social science research suggests the study of value systems across disciplines. For example, for the 41 values with a link to the World Values Survey (the WVS column in Table 1, Haerpfer et al., 2020), the corresponding dataset contains information on people’s value priorities (i.e., value systems) collected rigorously for 51 territories, with the earliest survey from 1981 and the latest from 2020.\n2Using the noun-phrase value names of Schwartz (1994).\nLevel Source Dataset frequency (size; cf.

      "text" : "Following the aspiration of a cross-cultural value taxonomy and using territories as a proxy for cultures, the dataset is composed of four parts: Africa, China, India, and USA. Each argument consists of one premise, one conclusions, and a stance attribute indicating whether the premise is in favor of (pro) or against (con) the conclusion. The USA part contains the majority of the arguments as we could reuse an existing dataset. However, as existing argument datasets are almost exclusively from a Western background, we had to collect new suitable arguments for the other parts. The respective non-US sources were recommended to us for their authenticity by students from the respective territory that work with our groups.\nAfrica We manually extracted 50 arguments from recent editorials of the debating ideas section of a pan-African news platform, African Arguments.4 Premises could often be extracted literally, but conclusions were mostly implicit and had to be compiled from several source sentences.\nChina We extracted 100 arguments from the recommendation and hotlist section of a Chinese\n3https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5657249 4https://africanarguments.org\nquestion-answering website, Zhihu.5 We manually identified key points (premises and conclusions) in the answers and translated them to English.\nIndia We extracted 100 arguments from the controversial debate topics 2021 section of Group Discussion Ideas.6 This blog collects pros and cons on various topics from Indian news to support discussions. Premises and conclusions were used as-is.\nUSA We took 5020 arguments with a manual argument quality rating of at least 0.5 from the 30,497 arguments of the IBM-ArgQ-Rank-30kArgs dataset (Gretz et al., 2020). For the dataset, crowdworkers wrote one pro and one con argument for one of 71 common controversial topics. We rephrased the topics to represent conclusions.\nDue to the difficulty of collecting datasets from various cultures, the number of respective arguments (250) is small compared to the US part. However, we will mainly use them for testing the robustness of identifying values in arguments.\nTable 2 shows one example from each part. Note that we do not see any part as representative for the respective culture, but rather as a necessary approximation (see Section 7 for a discussion). Table 3 provides an overview of the dataset. Premises are longer than conclusions, with USA having the lowest average for both. The Africa part has the fewest premises per conclusion (2.2) and the US part the most (70.7). The skew between pros and cons is highest for Africa with a ratio of about 3:1. All these observations are results of the collection process and are natural variations for arguments.\n5https://www.zhihu.com 6https://www.groupdiscussionideas.com"

      "heading" : "4.2 Crowdsourcing of Value Annotations",
      "text" : "We employed a custom three-part annotation interface, optimized for speed and task expertise acquisition through keyboard shortcuts and a clear template-like structure (see Appendix A for screenshots). Besides instructions and example arguments, a brief explanation of specific terms was given if needed (e.g., for the “996 overtime system” mentioned in several arguments from China). Below this introductory material, the main part of the interface consists of three panels. The first panel places the argument to be annotated in a scenario:\nImagine someone is arguing [in favor of/against] “[conclusion]” by saying: “[premise].”\nThe second panel formulated the annotation task for a value as a yes/no question.7 The question follows the operationalization of Section 3:\nIf asked “Why is that good?”, might this be their justification? “Because it is good to [value]”.\nFor illustration, example implications of matching arguments were provided. Instructions stated that one to five values are typical for an argument, and more than 10 should be avoided. A third panel shows the annotation progress. Annotators could write feedback on both arguments and values.\nThe crowdsourcing ran on the MTurk platform, with annotators taking 2:40 minutes per argument on average, and totaling 90 days of 8-hour work. We required them to have an approval rate of at least 98%, at least 100 approved work tasks, and— for language proficiency—being located in the US. No further personal information was gathered. The annotators were first restricted to three annotation tasks. Manual quality checks at this stage resulted in 154 work rejections (5% rejection rate) due to\n7To prevent order effects, the value order was randomized for each annotator, but then fixed to allow for learning.\nignored instructions. We then selected 27 annotators for annotating the bulk of arguments, ensuring at least 3 annotations per argument. As mandatory for MTurk, annotators were paid on a task basis, which led to an average hourly wage of $8.12 (current US federal minimum wage: $7.25). Additionally, we paid bonuses of total $65.65, especially to annotators who wrote extensive comments.\nWe employed MACE (Hovy et al., 2013) to fuse the annotations into a single ground truth, applying it value-wise as suggested by the author for multi-label annotations. Despite the difficulty of the annotation task, the annotators reached an average value-wise agreement α of 0.49 (Krippendorff, 2004). Moreover, we manually checked the 48 arguments (<1%) to which MACE assigned more than 10 values, reducing their values to the most prevalent 5–7 ones. The right side of Table 1 shows the frequency of each value in each dataset part.\nA value in the ground truth also automatically led to an assignment of all parent labels in the taxonomy (see Figure 1). Figure 2 shows the resulting level-wise distribution of labels per argument. As the majority of arguments are assigned both labels for Levels 4a and b, these base dichotomies for values are hence mostly not dichotomous for arguments. So, like the value systems of people, many arguments seem to resort to a broad spectrum of values from the value continuum at once. For example, the first argument in Table 2 resorts to both having a comfortable life (personal focus, self-protection) and having equality (social focus, growth). Similar to observations of Rokeach (1973, p. 50f) on value systems, this example showcases an interaction between values that change their psychological significance, where having equality gives having a comfortable life a social focus. We believe that our dataset enables scholars to study such interactions for arguments in the future."

      "text" : "This section presents a first attempt at automatically identifying human values using standard approaches. The first experiment focuses on the USA dataset part alone, the second on a crosscultural setting. We compare three approaches:8 BERT. Fine-tuned multi-label bert-base-uncased with batch size 8 and learning rate 2−5 (20 epochs). SVM. A linear kernel scikit-learn support vector machine trained label-wise with C = 18. 1-Baseline. Classifies each argument as resorting to all values. Thus always achieves a recall of 1.\nOur evaluation focuses on the label-wise F1score and its mean over all labels (macro-average), as well as its constituents precision and recall. We report accuracy for completeness, though the heavily skewed label distribution makes it less suited. The evaluation employs macro-averages for all metrics to give the same weight to all values. Note that the 1-Baseline is especially strong for the F1-score since it always achieves a recall of 1. For calculating the p-values when comparing approaches we employ the Wilcoxon signed rank significance test (Wilcox, 1996). As detailed in Section 4, most arguments actually have both labels of the base dichotomies (Levels 4a and b) assigned to them, so we do not discuss these levels deeper here."

      "heading" : "5.1 Results on the USA Part",
      "text" : "We first report results on the main part of our dataset (USA) as an experiment with matching training and test set. The approaches are trained on the arguments from 60 unique conclusions (4240 arguments), validated on 4 (277), and tested on 7 (503). Only one very rare value, be neat and tidy (0.2% of arguments in USA part), does not occur in this test set and is thus excluded from evaluation.\nTable 4 shows the results averaged over all labels. BERT performs best according to F1-score for Level 1 (p = 0.007 vs. SVM and p = 0.001 vs.\n8Source code: URL removed for blind review\n1-Baseline; n = 53) and for Level 2 (p = 0.153 and p = 0.117; n = 20), but is worse than or at the baseline for higher levels (n too small for test). While a F1-score of 0.25 is encouraging for largely out-of-the-box approaches, clearly more work is needed. Though a recall of 0.19 may be acceptable for applications that not rely on completeness, a precision of 0.40 seems low for practical uses.\nAs Figure 3 shows, however, considerably higher F1-scores are reached by BERT for several values and value categories. Specifically, the identification works exceptionally well for the value have good health (F1: 0.81) and the value-category security: personal (F1: 0.78) that contains it. Other value categories with F1 ≥ 0.5 are universalism: concern, self-direction: action, achievement, and benevolence: caring. The out-of-the-box models thus perform reasonably well for a few selected values and categories within the USA part. The complete results are distributed alongside the dataset."

      "heading" : "5.2 Results Across Culture",
      "text" : "For testing classification robustness, we here apply the same approaches without re-training to all test sets. The non-US parts are considerably smaller and as a result ~28% of the values are lacking arguments (cf. Table 1). However, the 1-Baseline is equally effected by this lack, thus providing for a comparison with the previous setting.\nTable 5 shows the F1-scores for each test set averaged over all labels. Once more, BERT performed best by the F1-score for Level 1 (p = 0.006 vs. SVM and p < 0.001 vs. 1-Baseline; n = 169) and Level 2 (both p < 0.001; n = 74), whereas no significant difference was found for Level 3 (p = 0.179 and p = 0.856; n = 16). BERT and SVM perform on Level 1 and 2 similar across parts. Maybe due to the clarity of its editored arguments, BERT performs best for India, despite the 1- Baseline performing best for USA. These findings constitute first evidence that using a cross-cultural value taxonomy could result in robust methods for identifying the values behind arguments."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "A computational identification of human values behind arguments is a challenging but also necessary task. With our research we contribute (1) a multilevel taxonomy with 54 values based on social science research, (2) a labeled dataset comprised of 5270 arguments from four sources, and (3) empirical analyses that cover multiple value granularity levels and compare different cultures.\nBased on this work a logical next step are analyses that fully exploit relationships between labels. Hierarchical classification approaches appear promising here (e.g., Babbar et al., 2013); learning rules for multi-label classification (e.g., Loza Mencía and Jannsen, 2016) can provide insights into value-relationships.\nMoreover, the dataset should be extended to include data from more cultures or territories, genres (e.g., blog posts), modalities (offline and spoken argumentation), and languages. Probably an auto-\nmated translation with manual assurance, as we did for the dataset’s China part, may not be sufficient. Though we optimized the annotation process, the argument acquisition requires a community effort to ensure the widest variety of data. Employing annotators from different cultures is a requirement to analyze and mitigate potential sources of bias. A subsequent step of ranking the annotated values by importance can be beneficial for certain use cases, especially when using the higher taxonomy levels.\nValues are a major contributor to argument strength (Bench-Capon, 2021), and the large-scale mining from web data could improve all of argument categorization, assessment, and generation. For example, matching values between arguments could be effective for both supporting and countering arguments. Similarly, an “objective” highlighting of common values behind arguments across political camps could be a step towards resolving seemingly fundamental disagreements."

      "text" : "Identifying values in argumentative texts could be used in various applications like argument faceted search, value-based argument generation, and value-based personality profiling. In all these applications, an analysis of values has the opportunity to broaden the discussion (e.g., by presenting a diverse set of arguments covering a wide spectrum of personal values in search or inviting people with underrepresented value-systems to discussions). At the same time, a value-based analysis could risk to exclude people or arguments based on their values. However, in other cases, for example hate speech, such an exclusion might be desirable.\nWhile we tried to include texts from different cultures in our dataset, it is important to note that these samples are not representative of their respective culture, but intended as a benchmark for measuring classification robustness across sources. A more significant community effort is needed to collect more solid datasets from a wider variety of sources. To facilitate the inclusivity of different cultures, we adopted a personal value taxonomy that has been developed targeting universalism and tested across cultures. However, in our study, the annotations have all been carried out by annotators from a western background. Even though the value taxonomy strives for universalism, a potential risk is that an annotator from a specific culture might fail to correctly interpret the implied values in a text written by people from a different culture.\nFinally, as mentioned in Section 4, we did not gather any personal information in our annotation studies, and we ensured that all our annotators get paid more than the minimum wage in the U.S."

Values are commonly accepted answers to why some option is desirable in the ethical sense and are thus essential both in real-world argumentation and theoretical argumentation frameworks. However, their large variety has been a major obstacle to modeling them in argument mining. To overcome this obstacle, we contribute an operationalization of human values, namely a multi-level taxonomy with 54 values that is in line with psychological research. Moreover, we provide a dataset of 5270 arguments from four geographical cultures, manually annotated for human values. First experiments with the automatic classification of human values are promising, with F1-scores up to 0.81 and 0.25 on average.",
