We examine how to avoid finetuning the pretrained language models (PLMs) on D2T generation datasets while still taking advantage of surface realization capabilities of PLMs. Inspired by pipeline approaches, we propose to generate text by rephrasing single-item templates using a sequence of modules trained on general-domain text-based operations—ordering, aggregation, and paragraph compression. We train PLMs for performing these operations on a synthetic corpus WIKIFLUENT which we build from English Wikipedia. Our experiments on two major triple-to-text datasets—WebNLG and E2E— show that our approach enables D2T generation from RDF triples in zero-shot settings.1"

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The aim of data-to-text (D2T) generation is to produce natural language descriptions of structured data (Gatt and Krahmer, 2018; Reiter and Dale, 1997). Although pipelines of rule-based D2T generation modules are still used in practice (Dale, 2020), end-to-end approaches based on PLMs recently showed superior benchmark performance (Ke et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020a; Ferreira et al., 2020; Kale and Rastogi, 2020b; Ribeiro et al., 2020), surpassing pipeline systems (Ferreira et al., 2019) in both automatic and human evaluation metrics.\nFinetuning PLMs on human-written references is widely accepted as a standard approach for adapting PLMs to the D2T generation objective and achieving good performance on a given benchmark (Agarwal et al., 2021; Ke et al., 2021). Nevertheless, this approach brings issues: Most obviously, finetuning the model for the domain-specific\n1The anonymized version of our code and data is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ zeroshot-d2t-pipeline/.\ndata distribution leads to overfitting on the particular benchmark, decreasing performance on outof-distribution data (Laha et al., 2020). Moreover, collecting a large set of references for a particular domain is costly and time-consuming, as the data are usually collected using crowdsourcing (Dušek et al., 2020). Few-shot approaches are an alternative, requring only several tens or hundreds of annotated examples (Chen et al., 2020c; Ke et al., 2021; Su et al., 2021a). However, robustness of these approaches is questionable—selecting a representative set of examples which would improve performance is difficult (Chang et al., 2021a), and the limited sample is often noisy, increasing the chance of hallucinations and omissions (Dušek et al., 2019; Harkous et al., 2020; Rebuffel et al., 2021).\nIn this paper, we provide an alternative to this traditional paradigm by formulating the D2T generation from RDF triples as a sequence of generaldomain operations over text in natural language. We start by transforming individual triples to text using trivial templates, which we subsequently or-\nder, aggregate, and compress on the paragraph level to produce the resulting description of the data. All the pipeline modules operate over natural language text and are built upon PLMs trained on our WIKIFLUENT corpus. WIKIFLUENT contains 934k examples of first paragraphs from the English Wikipedia, each supplied with a synthesized set of simple template-like sentences conveying the same meaning. Our approach allows generating natural language descriptions from triples with a minimum amount of domain-specific rules or knowledge and without using training data from the D2T datasets. We show that our approach can yield large improvements upon simple baselines and match older supervised systems in terms of fluency, while bringing potential for further improvements and advantages with respect to controllability.\nOur contributions are the following: (1) We propose an alternative D2T generation ap-\nproach based on general-domain text-to-text operations (ordering, aggregation, and paragraph compression). (2) We introduce a synthetic WIKIFLUENT corpus containing 934k sentences based on English Wikipedia, providing training data for the operations in (1). (3) We apply our system on two D2T datasets and evaluate its performance both automatically and manually, including the contribution of individual pipeline modules. (4) We release our code, data, pretrained models, and system outputs to ease future research."

      "text" : "D2T Generation with PLMs Large neural language models pretrained on self-supervised tasks (Lewis et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019) have recently gained a lot of traction in D2T generation research (Ferreira et al., 2020). Following Chen et al. (2020c), other works adopt PLMs for few-shot D2T generation (Chang et al., 2021b; Su et al., 2021a). Kale and Rastogi (2020b) and Ribeiro et al. (2020) showed that PLMs using linearized representations of data can outperform graph neural networks on graph-to-text datasets, recently surpassed again by graph-based models (Ke et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020a). Although the models make use of general-domain pretraining tasks, all of them are eventually finetuned on domain-specific data.\nTemplates in Data-Driven D2T Generation Using simple handcrafted templates for individual keys or predicates is an efficient way of introducing domain knowledge while preventing text-to-text models from overfitting to a specific data format (Heidari et al., 2021; Kale and Rastogi, 2020a; Kasner and Dušek, 2020). Transforming individual triples to text is also used in Laha et al. (2020) whose work is the most similar to ours. They also build a three-step pipeline for zero-shot D2T generation, but they use handcrafted rules for producing the output text and do not address content planning.\nContent Planning in D2T Generation Content planning, i.e. ordering input facts and aggregating them into individual sentences, is a traditional part of the D2T generation pipeline (Ferreira et al., 2019; Gatt and Krahmer, 2018; Reiter and Dale, 1997). As previously demonstrated, using a content plan in neural D2T generation has important impact on the overall text quality (Moryossef et al., 2019a,b; Puduppully et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020; Trisedya et al., 2020). Recently, Su et al. (2021b) have shown that using a content plan leads to improved quality of PLM outputs. All the aforementioned models plan directly using predicates or keys in the D2T datasets representing the corresponding data item. Unlike these works, our planner is trained on ordering sentences in natural language.\nSentence Ordering Sentence ordering is the task of organizing a set of natural language sentences to increase the coherence of a text (Barzilay et al., 2001; Lapata, 2003). Several neural methods for this task were proposed, using either interactions between pairs of sentences (Chen et al., 2016; Li and Jurafsky, 2017), global interactions (Gong et al., 2016; Wang and Wan, 2019), or combination of both (Cui et al., 2020). We base our ordering module (§5.1) on the recent work of Calizzano et al. (2021), who use a pointer network (Wang and Wan, 2019; Vinyals et al., 2015) on top of a PLM.\nFact Aggregation The compact nature of the target text description results in aggregating multiple facts in a single sentence. Previous works (Wiseman et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021) capture the segments which correspond to individual parts of the input as latent variables. Unlike these works, we adopt a simpler scenario using an already ordered sequence of facts, in which we selectively insert delimiters marking sentence boundaries.\nParagraph Compression We introduce paragraph compression as a new task in our D2T generation pipeline. As the last step in the pipeline, it is closely related to linguistic realisation, however— since we already work with natural language in this step—the focus of our task is on sentence fusion, rephrasing, and coreference resolution. Unlike text summarization or simplification (Zhang et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020), we aim to convey the complete semantics of the text without omitting any facts. In contrast to sentence fusion (Geva et al., 2019; Barzilay and McKeown, 2005) or sentence compression (Filippova and Altun, 2013), we operate in the context of multiple sentences in a paragraph. The task is the central focus of our WIKIFLUENT corpus (§4), which we synthesize using a model for the reverse task, split-andrephrase, i.e. splitting a complex sentence into simpler ones while preserving semantics (Botha et al., 2018; Narayan et al., 2017)."

Note that the filled templates are allowed to contain minor disfluencies since the text will be rephrased in the final step of the pipeline. See §5.5 for our approach to gathering the templates and Figure 2 for examples of the templates we use in our datasets.\nWe acknowledge that this step may be a bottleneck on datasets with an unconstrained (or very large) set of predicates, which is why we also discuss possibilities for automating this step in §7."

As we describe below in detail, we achieve that by applying a split-and-rephrase model and a coreference resolution model on a set of human-written paragraphs in English Wikipedia.

We train our model on the large-scale WikiSplit corpus by Botha et al. (2018), containing human-made sentence splits from Wikipedia edit history. Following the setup in the rest of our experiments, we train the encoder-decoder PLM BART-base (Lewis et al., 2020) on the WikiSplit dataset in a sequence-to-sequence setting. We apply the trained split-and-rephrase model on each sentence, uniformly randomly choosing between 0-2 recursive calls to ensure that the splits are not deterministic.

The COPY baseline is substantially better than the zero-shot system of Laha et al. (2020), suggesting that quality of the templates plays an important role. The 2-STAGE system is generally on par with the 3-STAGE system (or better), which indicates that implicit aggregation using the PC-AGG model may be sufficient.

These problems are only slightly reduced in the filtered version, but they are largely elim-\ninated with 2-STAGE and 3-STAGE models. We note these models create almost no hallucinations or omissions. However, the outputs on WebNLG for all systems suffer from semantic errors resulting from merging of unrelated facts. This mostly happens with unrelated predicates connected to the same subject/object (e.g. “X was born in Y”, “X worked as Z” expressed as “X worked as Z in Y”; see Appendix D for examples). On the E2E data, which has a simpler triple structure (all predicates share the same subject), the outputs are generally consistent and the 2-STAGE and 3-STAGE models exhibit almost no semantic errors. As we discuss in §7, more research is needed for ensuring the final consistency of the text. The grammar errors and disfluencies stem mainly from over-eager paragraph compression or from artifacts in our templates; they are relatively minor (e.g., missing “is” in “serves French food and family-friendly”)."

Generating simple statements from the triples automatically, e.g., using the approach of Laha et al.

Moreover, explicitly including a denoising task for the paragraph compression model could help to tackle the disfluencies in the templates.\nMore research is also needed on semantic errors stemming from merging of facts in improper ways. We suggest that explicitly controlling the semantics of sentence fusion (Ben-David et al., 2020) could help to mitigate this issue, while still keeping the advantages of a zero-shot approach."

We train the models for 1 epoch on a single GeForce RTX 3090 GPU with 24 GB RAM. We use greedy decoding in all our experiments.\nB.2 Ordering For training the ordering model, we used the implementation from Calizzano et al. (2021) 8 including their training parameters. We plan to fully integrate the ordering model into our framework in the future."

For example, the following regular expression used in the slot-error script:\nprices?(?: range)?(?:w+)0,3 high\nmatches \"(...) price range and high customer rating (...)\", incorrectly classifying the presence of the extra slot priceRange[high]. This importance of this problem is exacerbated by the consistent\n8https://github.com/airKlizz/ passage-ordering\n9https://github.com/tuetschek/e2e-cleaning/ blob/master/slot_error.py\noutputs of our models, which tend to repeat certain patterns. However, we also manually identified several cases in which an error was found correctly, e.g. the model hallucinating \"3 out of 4 customer rating\" instead of \"3 out of 5 customer rating\"."

Tables 12 and 13 show examples of behavior of our models on the E2E dataset.\nThe green color marks the model outputs which are completely correct, the red color marks the errors. For better readability of the input format, we add numeric order identifiers for the individual facts (bold, in squared brackets). These are subsequently used as references in the Order and Aggregation rows. Note that zero-th input in E2E is used as a subject in the RDF triples."

We train PLMs for performing these operations on a synthetic corpus WIKIFLUENT which we build from English Wikipedia. Our experiments on two major triple-to-text datasets—WebNLG and E2E— show that our approach enables D2T generation from RDF triples in zero-shot settings.1",
