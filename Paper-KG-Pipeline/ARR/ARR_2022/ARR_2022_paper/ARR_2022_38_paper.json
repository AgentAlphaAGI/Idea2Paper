      "text" : "Temporal knowledge graphs (KGs) record the relations between entities and the timestamp or time period when such relation hold, e.g., in the form of a quadruple: (Franklin D. Roosevelt, position held, President of USA, [1933, 1945]). This makes them a perfect source of knowledge to answer questions that involve knowledge of when certain events occurred as well as how they are related temporally (see Figure 1 for an example). Unlike question answering (QA) over non-temporal KGs that is\nmainly concerned with relational inference, a core challenge in temporal KGQA is correctly identifying the time of reference mentioned explicitly or implicitly in the question, and locating relevant facts by jointly reasoning over relations and timestamps.\nInspired by work on relational KGQA (Huang et al., 2019; Saxena et al., 2020), where knowledge graph embeddings (Dasgupta et al., 2018; García-Durán et al., 2018; Goel et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Lacroix et al., 2020) learned independently of question answering are used as input to KGQA models, previous work (Saxena et al., 2021) employs temporal KG embeddings to attack the problem of temporal KGQA. Despite its relative success on simple temporal questions that directly queries facts in the KG with one out of the four facts left as the answer (e.g., “When was Franklin D. Roosevelt the President of USA?” or “What position did Franklin D. Roosevelt hold between 1933 and 1945?”), this approach still struggles to handle questions that require multiple steps of relationaltemporal reasoning (e.g., the example in Figure 1).\nWe identify three main challenges that hinder further progress on temporal KGQA. Firstly, complex temporal questions often require inferring the correct point of reference in time, which is not considered by previous work. For instance, to correctly answer the question in Figure 1, it is crucial that we first identify that World War II took place between 1939 and 1945, and look for entities with the desired relation with President of USA in the time interval specified by these times. Secondly, unlike entity relations, which are usually expressed in natural language with a handful of content words that correspond well with their recorded relations in KGs (e.g., “What position did ... hold ...” vs the “position held” relation), temporal relations often involve just one or two prepositions (e.g., “before” or “during”) and are expressed only implicitly in temporal KGs (e.g., nowhere is it clearly stated that 1931 is earlier than, or before, 1934, by a gap of 3 years). As a result, a small lexical change can drastically alter the temporal relation expressed by the question, and therefore the answer set. Thirdly, previous work on temporal KGQA build on temporal KG embeddings, where each timestamp is assigned a randomly initialized vector representation that is jointly optimized with entity and relation representations to reconstruct quadruples in the KG from embeddings. While sound as a standalone method for encoding knowledge in temporal KGs, this approach does not guarantee that the learned timestamp representations can recover implicit temporal relations like temporal orders or distance, which are crucial for temporal KGQA.\nIn this paper, we propose a time-sensitive question answering framework (TSQA) to address these challenges. We first equip the temporal KGQA model with a time estimation module that infers the unstated timestamps from questions as the first step of reasoning, and feed the result into relational inference as a reference timestamp. Even without explicit training data for this module, the explicit factorization of the problem yields significant improvement over previous work on complex questions that require reasoning over multiple temporal quadruples. To improve the sensitivity of our question encoder to time relation words, we also propose auxiliary contrastive losses that contrast the answer prediction and time estimation for questions that differ only by the time relation word (e.g., “before” vs “after”). By leveraging the mutual exclusiveness of answers and the prior knowledge\nregarding potential time estimates from different time relation words, we observe further improvements in model performance on complex questions. Next, to learn temporal KG embeddings with prior knowledge of temporal order and distance built in, we introduce an auxiliary loss of time-order classification between each pair of timestamp embeddings. As a result, the knowledge in the temporal KG can be distilled into the entity, relation, and timestamp embeddings where the timestamp embeddings can naturally recover order and distance information between the underlying timestamps, thus improving the performance of temporal KGQA where such information is crucial. Finally, we enhance TSQA with KG-based approaches to narrow the search space to speed up model training and inference, as well as reduce the number of false positives in model prediction. As a result, TSQA outperforms the previous state of the art on the CRONQUESTIONS benchmark (Saxena et al., 2021) by a large margin.\nTo summarize, our contributions in this paper are: a) we propose a time-sensitive question answering framework (TSQA) that performs time estimation for complex temporal answers; b) we present contrastive losses that improve model sensitivity to time relation words in the question; c) we propose a time-sensitive temporal KG embedding approach that benefits temporal KGQA; d) with the help of KG-based pruning technique, our TSQA model outperforms the previous state of the art by a large margin."

      "text" : "Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding. Knowledge graph embedding learning (Bordes et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014; Trouillon et al., 2016; Dettmers et al., 2018; Shang et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019; Ji et al., 2021) has been an active research area with applications directly in knowledge base completion and relation extractions. Recently, there are several works that extended the static KG embedding models to temporal KGs. Jiang et al. (2016) first attempt to extend TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) by adding a timestamp embedding into the score function. Later, Hyte (Dasgupta et al., 2018) projects each timestamp with a corresponding hyperplane and utilizes the TransE score in each space. García-Durán et al. (2018) extend TransE and DistMult by utilizing recurrent neural networks\nto learn time-aware representations of relation types. TCompLEx (Lacroix et al., 2020) extends the ComplEx with time based on the canonical decomposition of tensors of order 4.\nTemporal QA on Knowledge Graph. Temporal QA have mostly been studied in the context of reading comprehension. ForecastQA (Jin et al., 2021) formulates the forecasting problem as a multiplechoice question answering task, where both the articles and questions include the timestamps. The recent released TORQUE (Ning et al., 2020) is a dataset that explores the temporal ordering relations between events described in a passage of text.\nAnother direction is the temporal question answering over knowledge bases (KB) (Jia et al., 2018b,a), which retrieves time information from the KB. TempQuestions (Jia et al., 2018a) is a KGQA dataset specifically aimed at temporal QA. Based on this dataset, Jia et al. (2018b) design a method that decomposes and rewrites each question into nontemporal sub-question and temporal sub-question. Here the KG used in TempQuestions is based on a subset of FreeBase which is not a temporal KG. Later Jia et al. (2021) proposes a first end-to-end system (EXAQT) for answering complex temporal questions, which takes advantage of the question-relevant compact subgraphs within the KG, and relational graph convolutional networks (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) for predicting the answers. All previous datasets only include a limited number of temporal questions. Recently, a much larger temporal KGQA dataset CRONQUESTIONS (Saxena et al., 2021) is released, which includes both the temporal questions and the temporal KG with time annotation for all edges. Based on this dataset, the CronKGQA model (Saxena et al., 2021) is presented that exploits recent advances in Temporal KG embeddings and achieves performance superior to all baselines."

Edge from a quadruple (s, r, [ts, te], o) indicates the relation r ∈ R holds between subject entity s and object entity o during time interval [ts, te] (ts < te and te/s ∈ T ). Framework. Our framework resorts to KG embeddings along with pretrained language models to perform temporal KGQA. Figure 2 shows the architecture which consists of two modules: 1) time-aware TKG encoder; 2) time-sensitive question answer.\nThe time-aware TKG encoder extends the existing TKG embedding method by adding an auxiliary time-order learning task to consider the quadruple orders. And the time sensitive QA module first performs neighboring graph extraction to reduce the search space for question answer, then performs joint training for answer/time prediction and timesensitive contrastive learning to enhance the model ability in capturing temporal signals in free-text question.

      "text" : "We first briefly review a time-aware KG embedding method based on TCompLEx (Lacroix et al., 2020) since it has been used in (Saxena et al., 2021) for TKGQA and shows competitive performance. Next, we show that how to perform TCompLEx on temporal KG, then analyze its weakness in TKGQA especially for complex question and further overcome such weakness by introducing an auxiliary time-order learning task in TKG embedding. TCompLEx for TKG. TCompLEx is an extension of ComplEx considering time information, which not only encodes the entity and relation to complex vectors, but also maps each timestamp to a complex vector. To perform TCompLEx over temporal KG in our problem definition, we first reformulate each quadruple to a set of new quadruples by\n(s, r, [ts, te], o) = {(s, r, t, o)|ts ≤ t ≤ te} (1)\nLet es, er, et, eo ∈ Cd be the complex-value embeddings of s, r, t, o, respectively. Then, TCom-\npLEx scores each quadruple (s, r, t, o) by\nS(s, r, o, t) = Re(⟨es, er, eo, et⟩) (2)\nwhere Re(.) denotes the real part of a complex vector, and ⟨⟩ denotes the multi-linear product.\nFinally, we use a loss function similar to the negative sampling loss for effectively TCompLEx training.\nLTC = −log(ϕ(γ − S(s, r, o, t)))\n− 1 K K∑ i=1 (log(ϕ(S(s′i, r, o′i, t′i)− γ))), (3)\nwhere γ is a fixed margin, ϕ is the sigmoid function, (s′i, r, o ′ i, t ′ i) is the i-th negative quadruple.\nAccording to the loss function in equation 3, we observe that TCompLEx only cares about whether the quadruple is true or false and ignores the orders of different quadruples occur. However, the time orders are critical to find the correct answer in knowledge graphs. For example, to answer the ‘Who is the President of USA before William J. Clinton?”, we need not only the two facts (President of USA, Position Held, Ronald Reagan, [1981, 1989]) and (President of USA, Position Held, William J. Clinton, [1993, 2001]), but also the time order of these facts. To overcome such a limit of TCompLEx in TKGQA, we introduce an auxiliary time-order learning task over time-embeddings. Time-order learning in TKG. To keep the time order in embedding spaces, we first sort the timestamps in T by an ascending order and get (t1, t2, · · · , t|T |) and ti < tj if 1 ≤ i < j ≤ |T |.\nLet ti = [Re(eti), Im(eti)] ∈ R2d be the concatenation the real and imaginary components of embedding eti of timestamp ti. Inspired by position embedding in (Vaswani et al., 2017), we first initialize the timestamp embedding ti as follows.\nti[2k] = sin( i\n100002k/2d )\nti[2k + 1] = cos( i\n100002k/2d )\n(4)\nwhere 0 ≤ k ≤ d− 1. Afterwards, for any pair of timestamps (ti, tj), we calculate the probability of time order as:\npt(i, j) = sigmoid((t1 − t2)TWt), (5)\nwhere Wt ∈ R2d represents a parameter vector. Based on the time-order probabilities, we introduce a binary cross-entropy loss as a time-order constraint over timestamp embeddings as follow:\nLTO =− δ(i, j) log(pt(i, j)) − (1− δ(i, j)) log(1− pt(i, j)), (6)\nwhere δ(i, j) = 1 if ti < tj else δ(i, j) = 0. Joint-training. A weighted sum of T-CompLEx training loss and time-order constraint is considered as the final objective function for the joint training for TKG embedding."

However, the existing method (Saxena et al., 2021) usually performs such two predictions independently which results in poor performance especially for complex questions which need to consider multiple facts to get the answer. To overcome this limitation, we directly feed the intermediate time representation tq learned from time estimation to answer prediction to enhance the interaction of these two tasks. Time Estimation. Based on the embeddings es and eo of subject entity s and object entity o from KG and the time embedding qt from a question, we design the time estimation function FT for learning the time embedding tq as follows:1\ntq = FT (es, qt, eo)\n= W tq ([Re(⟨es, qt, eo⟩), Im(⟨es, qt, eo⟩)]), (11) where W tq ∈ R2d×2d represents the parameter matrix.

For example, the answer of “What does happen before a given event?” is quite different from that of “What does happen after a given event?”. Existing works on TKG-QA usually resort to pre-trained language models for question understanding. But these models are not sensitive to the difference of temporal expressions in freetext (Ning et al., 2020; Dhingra et al., 2021; Shang et al., 2021; Han et al., 2021), and thus prone to wrong predictions.\nTo make the system sensitive to the temporal relation implied in question, we resort to a contrastive learning method: we construct a contrastive question to the original question, then add auxiliary contrastive learning tasks to distinguish the latent temporal representation and prediction results coming from the pair of contrastive questions. Contrastive Question Generation. To generate the contrastive question Q̄ for the given question Q, we first extract all the temporal words based on large number of questions in temporal question answer dataset, and then build a contrastive word pair\ndictionary by finding the antonyms. The dictionary consists of Dcontr = {(first, last), (before, after), (before, during), (during, after), (before, when), (when, after)}. Based on such dictionary, we replace the temporal word in given question Q by its antonym to generate its contrastive question Q̄. Contrastive time order learning. For the contrastive question pair Q and Q̄, we follow the same encoder in Eq. 11 to get the corresponding timeaware embeddings tq and tqc , respectively. Meanwhile, according to the contrastive temporal word pair dictionary, suppose that we pickup the pair (word1, word2) ∈ Dcontr for contrastive question construction, we can construct a question order label yo: yo = 0 if Q̄ is achieved by replacing word1 as word2, else yo = 1.\nAfterward, we distinguish the temporal orders implied by word1 and word2 by predicting of the order label yo based on tq and tqc as follow:\npo = sigmoid((tq − tqc)TWo) (17) Lorder = −yo log(po)− (1− yo) log(1− po),\n(18)\nwhere Wo ∈ R2d represents the parameter vector to be learned.

    "abstractText" : "Question answering over temporal knowledge graphs (KGs) efficiently uses facts contained in a temporal KG, which records entity relations and when they occur in time, to answer natural language questions (e.g., “Who was the president of the US before Obama?”). These questions often involve three time-related challenges that previous work fail to adequately address: 1) questions often do not specify exact timestamps of interest (e.g., “Obama” instead of 2000); 2) subtle lexical differences in time relations (e.g., “before” vs “after”); 3) off-the-shelf temporal KG embeddings that previous work builds on ignore the temporal order of timestamps, which is crucial for answering temporal-order related questions. In this paper, we propose a time-sensitive question answering (TSQA) framework to tackle these problems. TSQA features a timestamp estimation module to infer the unwritten timestamp from the question. We also employ a time-sensitive KG encoder to inject ordering information into the temporal KG embeddings that TSQA is based on. With the help of techniques to reduce the search space for potential answers, TSQA significantly outperforms the previous state of the art on a new benchmark for question answering over temporal KGs, especially achieving a 32% (absolute) error reduction on complex questions that require multiple steps of reasoning over facts in the temporal KG.",
