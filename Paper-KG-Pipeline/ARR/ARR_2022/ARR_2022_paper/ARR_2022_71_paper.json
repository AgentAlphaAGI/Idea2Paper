      "text" : "In this work, we propose the Succinct Document Representation (SDR) scheme that computes highly compressed intermediate document representations, mitigating the storage/network issue. Our approach first reduces the dimension of token representations by encoding them using a novel autoencoder architecture that uses the document’s textual content in both the encoding and decoding phases. After this token encoding step, we further reduce the size of the document representations using modern quantization techniques.\nEvaluation on MSMARCO’s passage rereranking task show that compared to existing approaches using compressed document representations, our method is highly efficient, achieving 4x–11.6x higher compression rates for the same ranking quality. Similarly, on the TREC CAR dataset, we achieve 7.7x higher compression rate for the same ranking quality."

      "text" : "Information retrieval (IR) systems traditionally comprise of two stages: retrieval and ranking. Given a user query, the role of the retrieval stage is to quickly retrieve a set of candidate documents from a (very large) search index. Retrieval is typically fast but not accurate enough; in order to improve the quality of the end result for the user, the\ncandidate documents are re-ranked using a more accurate but computationally expensive algorithm.\nNeural approaches have achieved the state of the art ranking performance in IR applications (Yates et al., 2021). Transformer networks such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) consistently show better ranking effectiveness at the cost of a higher computational cost and latency (Nogueira and Cho, 2019).\nTo rank k documents, the ranker is called k times with an input of the form (query, document), where the query is the same, but the document is different. Several works (MacAvaney et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020b; Chen et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020b; Khattab and Zaharia, 2020) have proposed to modify BERT-based rankers in a way that allows part of the model to compute query and document representations separately, and then produce the final score using a low-complexity interaction block; we denote these models as lateinteraction rankers. Such approaches pre-compute document representations to improve latency significantly. Next, at runtime the model computes\nthe query representation (once), retrieves the precomputed document representations, and is only required to run a low-complexity interaction block k times to produce the final ranking score.\nPrecomputing document representations has shown to significantly reduce latency and at the same time retain comparable scores to BERT models (Gao et al., 2020b). However, this does not account for additional storage and/or network fetching latency costs. The representations typically consist of the contextual token embeddings in a transformer model, which consume orders of magnitude more storage than storing the entire corpus search index (cf. § 5.1).\nIn this work, we propose Succinct Document Representation (SDR), a general scheme for compressing document representations. It enables lateinteraction rankers to be efficient in both latency and storage, while maintaining high ranking quality. SDR is suitable for any ranking scheme that uses contextual embeddings, and achieves extreme compression ratios (2-3 orders of magnitude) with little to no impact on retrieval accuracy. SDR consists of two major components: (1) embedding dimension reduction using an autoencoder with side information and (2) distribution-optimized quantization of the reduced-dimension vectors.\nIn SDR, the autoencoder consists of two subnetworks: an encoder that reduces the vector’s dimensions and a decoder that reconstructs the compressed vector. The encoder’s output dimension represents the tradeoff between reconstruction fidelity and storage requirements. To improve the compression-reliability tradeoff, we leverage static token embeddings, which are available given that the ranker has access to the document text (as it needs to render it to the user), and are computationally cheap to obtain. We feed these embeddings to both the encoder and decoder as side information, allowing the autoencoder to focus more on storing “just the context” of a token, and less on its original meaning that is available in the static embeddings. Ablation tests verify that adding the static vectors significantly improves the compression rates for the same ranker accuracy.\nSince data storage is measured in bits rather than floating-point numbers, SDR uses quantization techniques to reduce storage size further. Given that it is hard to evaluate the amount of information in each of the encoder’s output dimensions, we perform a randomized Hadamard transform on the\nvectors, resulting in (1) evenly spread information across all coordinates and (2) transformed vectors that follow a Gaussian-like distribution. We utilize known quantization techniques to represent these vectors using a small number of bits, controlling for the amount of quantization distortion.\nExisting late-interaction schemes either ignore the storage overhead, or consider basic compression techniques, such as a simple (1 layer) autoencoder and float16 quantization. However, this is insufficient to reach reasonable storage size (MacAvaney et al., 2020); furthermore, this results in an increased fetching latency. For the MSMARCO dataset, we used a distilled model with a reduced vector width (Hofstätter et al., 2020a) as the initialized pre-trained weights for the late-interaction model. On top of this, we used a non-linear autoencoder consisting of 2 dense layers followed by float16 quantization, a natural extension of MacAvaney et al. (2020). This baseline achieves compression rates of 30x with no noticeable reduction in retrieval accuracy (measured with the official MRR@10 metric). In comparison with this strong baseline, our SDR scheme achieves an additional compression rate of between 4x to 11.6x with the same ranking quality, reducing document representation size to the same order of magnitude as the retrieved text itself. In Figure 1 we include a high-level presentation of the baseline, a variant of our method with float16 quantization, and our full method. For the TREC CAR dataset, for which we do not have a reduced-width baseline, we used a BERT model as the pre-trained weights for the late-interaction model. The baseline with 2 dense layers and float16 quantization achieves a 30x compression rates with a slight reduction in accuracy. The SDR scheme reaches the same quality while improving compression rate by another 7.7x.\nWe make the following contributions:\n• We propose the Succinct Document Representation (SDR) scheme for compressing the document representations required for fast Transformer-based rankers. The scheme is based on a specialized autoencoder architecture and subsequent quantization.\n• For the MSMARCO passage retrieval task, SDR shows compression ratios of 121x with no noticeable decrease in ranking performance. Compared to existing approaches for producing compressed representations, our method attains better compression rates (between 4x and 11.6x) for the\nsame ranking quality. Similar results are demonstrated on the TREC CAR dataset.\n• We provide a thorough analysis of the SDR system, showing that the contribution of each of the components to the compression-ranking effectiveness is significant."

      "text" : "Late-interaction models. The idea of running several transformer layers for the document and the query independently, and then combining them in the last transformer layers, was developed concurrently by multiple teams: PreTTR (MacAvaney et al., 2020), EARL (Gao et al., 2020a), DC-BERT (Nie et al., 2020), DiPair (Chen et al., 2020), and the Deformer (Cao et al., 2020). These works show that only a few layers where the query and document interact are sufficient to achieve results close to the performance of a full BERT ranker at a fraction of the runtime cost. For each document, the contextual token vectors are stored in a cache and retrieved during the document ranking phase. This impacts both storage cost as well as latency cost of fetching these vectors during the ranking phase. MORES (Gao et al., 2020b), extends lateinteraction models, where in the last interaction layers only the query attends to the document (and not vice-versa). As document are typically much longer, this results in additional performance improvements with similar storage requirements. ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020) is another variant that runs all transformer layers independently for the query and the document, and the interaction between the final vectors is done through a sumof-max operator. A similar work, the TransformerKernel (TK) (Hofstätter et al., 2020b), has an interaction block based on a low-complexity kernel operation. Both ColBERT and TK result in models with lower runtime latency at the expense of a drop in ranking quality. However, the storage requirements for both approaches are still significant.\nSome of the works above acknowledge the issue of storing the precomputed document representations and proposed partial solutions. In ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020), the authors proposed to reduce the dimension of the final token embedding using a linear layer. However, even moderate compression ratios caused a large drop in ranking quality. In the PreTTR model (MacAvaney et al., 2020), it was proposed to address the storage cost by using a standard auto-encoder architecture\nand the float16 format instead of float32. Again, the ranking quality drops even with moderate compression ratios (they measured up to 12x).\nSeveral other works (Guu et al., 2020; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020) proposed representing the queries and documents as vectors (as opposed to a vector per token), and using dot product as the interaction block. While this ranker architecture approach is simple (and can also be used for the retrieval step via an approximate nearest neighbor search such as FAISS (Johnson et al., 2017) or ScaNN (Guo et al., 2020)), the overall ranking quality is generally lower compared to methods that employ a query-document cross-attention interaction.\nCompressed embeddings. Our work reduces storage requirements by reducing the number of bits per floating-point value. Quantization gained attention and success in reducing the size of neural network parameters (Gupta et al., 2015; Essam et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018) and distributed learning communication costs (Suresh et al., 2017; Alistarh et al., 2017; Konečnỳ and Richtárik, 2018; Vargaftik et al., 2021b). Specifically, compressing word embeddings has been studied as an independent goal. May et al. (2019) studied the effect of quantized word embeddings on downstream applications and proposed a metric for quantifying this effect with simple linear models that operate on the word embeddings directly. As our work is concerned with compressing contextual embeddings, these methods do not apply since the set of possible embeddings values is not bounded by the vocabulary size. Nevertheless, as in (May et al., 2019), we also observe that simple quantization schemes are quite effective. Our work uses recent advances in this area to further reduce storage requirements for document representation, which, to the best of our knowledge, were not previously attempted in this context."

      "text" : "To compress document representations, we reduce the dimensionality of token representations (i.e., the output of BERT’s L-th layer) using an autoencoder. Standard autoencoder architectures typically consist of a neural network split into an encoder and a decoder: the encoder projects the input vector into a lower-dimension vector, which is then reconstructed back using the decoder.\nOur architecture, AESI, extends the standard autoencoder by using the document’s text as side information to both the encoder and decoder. Such an approach is possible since, no matter how the document scores are computed, re-ranking systems have access to the document’s text in order to render it back to the user. In the rest of this section, we add the precise details of the AESI architecture.\nSide Information. In line with our observation that the ranker has access to the document’s raw text, we propose utilizing the token embedding information, which is computed by the embedding layer used in BERT’s architecture. The token embeddings encode rich semantic information about the token itself; however, they do not fully capture the context in which they occur; hence, we refer to them as static embeddings. For example, through token embeddings, we cannot disambiguate between the different meanings of the token bank, which can refer to either a geographical location (e.g., “river bank”) or a financial institution, depending on the context.\nStatic embeddings are key for upper BERT layers, which learn the contextual representation of tokens via the self-attention mechanism. We use the static embeddings as side information to both the encoder and decoder parts of the autoencoder.\nThis allows the model to focus on encoding the distilled context, and less on the token information since it is already provided to the decoder directly.\nAESI Approach. For a token whose representation we wish to compress, our approach proceeds as follows. We take the L-th layer’s output contextual representation of the token together with its static embedding and feed both inputs to the autoencoder. The information to be compressed (and reconstructed) is the contextual embedding, and the side-information, which aids in the compression task, is the static embedding. The decoder takes the encoder output, along with the static embedding, and attempts to reconstruct the contextual embedding. Figure 2 shows the AESI architecture.\nAESI approach has two parameters that are determined empirically. First, the L-th transformer layer of the contextual representation provided as input, which has a direct impact on latency1. Second, the size of the encoder’s output directly impacts the compression rate and thus storage costs.\nEncoding starts by concatenating the input vector (i.e., the output of layer L, the vector we compress) and the static token embedding (i.e., the output of BERT’s embedding layer), and then passes the concatenated vector through an encoder network, which outputs a c-dimensional encoded vector. Decoding starts by concatenating the encoded vector with the static token embedding, then passes the concatenated vector through a decoder layer, which reconstructs the input vector. Specifically, we use a two-layer dense network for both the encoder and the decoder, which can be written using the following formula:\ne = E(v, u) := W e2 · ( gelu ( W e1 (v;u) )) (1)\nv′ = D(e, u) := W d2 · ( gelu ( W d1 (e;u) )) (2)\nwhere v ∈ Rh is the contextualized token embedding (the output of the L-th layer), u ∈ Rh is the static token embedding (the output of the embedding layer, which is the input to BERT’s layer 0 and includes token position embeddings and type embeddings), and u; v means concatenation of these vectors. W e1 ∈ Ri×2h, W e2 ∈ Rc×i, W d1 ∈ Ri×(c+h), W d2 ∈ Rh×i are trainable parameters. h is the dimension of token embeddings (e.g., 384), i is the intermediate autoencoder size, and c is the dimension of the projected (encoded) vector. gelu(·) is an non-linear activation function\n1A ranker has to compute layers L+ 1 onward online.\n(Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016).

      "heading" : "3.2 Quantization",
      "text" : "Storing the compressed contextual representations in a naive way consumes 32 bits (float32) per coordinate per token, which is still costly. To further reduce storage overhead, we propose to apply a quantization technique, which uses a predetermined B bits per coordinate. However, different coordinates and different tokens have different importance and possibly also different scales, so using the same number of bits and same quantization threshold for all of them increases the quantization error.\nTo remediate this issue, we follow the DRIVE approach (Vargaftik et al., 2021a), which uses a randomized Hadamard transform prior to quantization. Loosely speaking, this shuffles the information across all coordinates. Furthermore, each of the coordinates is guaranteed to follow Gaussianlike distribution, for which quantization boundaries can be computed optimally. For the sake of brevity, the full description of the quantization algorithm is deferred to Appendix A.\nEfficiently applying the Hadamard transform requires the size of the input to be a power of two. In addition, the input dimension should be large enough (specifically, larger than the output of AESI) so that information can be shuffled effectively. Therefore, we concatenate the AESI vectors of all tokens from a single document, then segment it to a larger block size (we use 128), padding the last block with zeros when necessary. The padding slightly increases space requirements and is consid-\nered when evaluating the compression efficiency."

MSMARCO passage re-ranking In this task (Nguyen et al., 2016), we are given a query and a list of 1,000 passages (retrieved via BM25), and the task is to rerank the passages according to their relevance to the query. The corpus consists of 8.8M passages, downloaded from the web. We consider two query sets:\n(1) MSMARCO-DEV, the development set for the MSMARCO passage reranking task, which consists of 6,980 queries. On average, each query has a single relevant passage, and other passages are not annotated. The models are measured using the mean reciprocal rank metric (MRR@10).\n(2) TREC 2019 DL Track. Here we consider the test queries from TREC 2019 DL Track passage reranking dataset. Unlike the above, there are many passages annotated for each query, and there are graded relevance labels (instead of binary labels). This allows us to use the more informative nDCG@10 metric. Due to the excessive annotation overhead, this dataset consists of just 200 queries, so results are noisier compared to MSMARCO-DEV.\nTREC Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR) is a dataset (Dietz et al., 2017) curated from Wikipedia, and consists of 30M passages, making storage requirements a bigger challenge compared to the MSMARCO task. The test query set consists of 2,254 queries with an average of 2.74 positive passages per query. We use the MAP@1K official metric.\nFor both datasets, in addition to the quality metrics, we also measure the Compression Ratio (CR) as the amount of storage required to store the token embeddings when compared to the baseline model. E.g., CR = 10 implies storage size that is one tenth of the baseline vectors.\n4.2 Baseline – BERTSPLIT Our algorithm is based on the late-interaction architecture (MacAvaney et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020a; Nie et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020). We created a model based on this architecture, which we name BERTSPLIT, consisting of 10 layers that are computed independently for the query and the document with an additional two lateinteraction layers that are executed jointly. For MSMARCO, we initialized the model from reduced width pre-trained weights2 and fine-tuned it using knowledge distillation from an ensemble of BERTLarge, BERT-Base, and ALBERT-Large (Hofstätter et al., 2020b) on the MSMARCO small training dataset, which consists of almost 40M tuples of query, a relevant document, and an irrelevant document.

The Distilbert model has the highest quality and smallest index size (since it is only executed online). However, ranking latency is prohibitively expensive. As a baseline, we use a late interaction model, a two-layer autoencoder with code dimension 24 and float16 quantization, denoted Late+AE-24. For this baseline, the ranking latency is significantly reduced at a cost in terms of quality. However, the document representation is large, causing retrieval and overall latency to increase to 0.7 and 1.22 seconds, respectively. SDR, with a dimension of 16 and 6-bits quantization, reaches the same quality as the baseline while striking a better balance between retrieval and ranking latency, reaching overall latency of 1.1 seconds. The index size is also significantly reduced compared to the baseline compression algorithm.\nWe also consider variants of the algorithms where the documents are pre-tokenized, and the tokenization output is retrieved instead of computing at runtime (marked as +tok in the table). This further improves the ranking latency at the expense of a slight increase in index size. Note that the baseline does not use the raw text and therefore does not benefit from precomputed tokens.\nTable 1 (bottom) shows the latency results on the CAR dataset. Here too, the BERT baseline has the highest ranking quality, at the cost of prohibitive latency. The late interaction variants we consider have the same configuration as in the MSMARCO case, where the baseline uses 24 features (with float16 quantization) and SDR uses 16 features (with 6 bits DRIVE quantization). Unlike in the MSMARCO case, the quality (i.e., MAP@1k score) of these two options is not similar. This makes SDR better than the baseline in latency, index size, as well as quality (by a large margin of over 14%).\nIn Appendix D we explore additional configurations and show that the baseline with 52 features reaches the same quality as SDR-16-6b. However, we do not measure end-to-end latency for this case due to the excessive storage size and indexing time. Note that using 52 features for the baseline is expected to have a negative impact on retrieval latency, making the benefits of SDR even more pronounced."

Standard 2-layer autoencoder with gelu activation. This is the same as AESI, only without the side information. AutoEncoder with 1 Layer (AE-1L). Standard autoencoder with a single dense layer in the encoder and decoder. AESI with 1 Layer (AESI-1L). AESI with a single dense encoder and decoder layer. DECoder-only AESI (AESI-DEC-2L).

Providing the side information to the autoencoder proves to be very effective in reducing storage costs, especially when the encoded vector size is small. A 2-layer encoder/decoder model, as expected, is more effective than a singlelayer model.

Due to lack of space, the results appear in Appendix B. We found that a randomized Hadamard transform improves quality (assuming similar bit rate), especially in the low-bits regime. Using a quantization technique fitted to the Gaussian distribution of post randomized Hadamard transform data further improve quality, making the DRIVE quantization superior to other quantization techniques in our case.\nOur scheme uses a fixed number of bits per coordinate, which is essential for performance. How-\never, variable-rate compression can further reduce storage. We used rate-distortion theory (from the information theory field) to upper bound the benefits of such techniques by 11%, which does not seem to justify the added system complexity (cf. Appendix B).\nIntrinsic Evaluation of AESI-Encoded Vectors To better understand the impact of side information, we measure the error rate between an input vector and a reconstructed vector (i.e., after encoding and decoding) for different input vectors. As expected, in practically all cases, adding the side information reduces error rate compared to a 2-layer autoencoder (AE-2L) with the same code dimension.\nIn the information retrieval field, the document frequency of a token is known to negatively correlated with the token’s importance. We found that the error rate for AE-2L decreases with frequency, while the error rate for AESI increases with frequency. This shows that the AESI scheme has a better focus on tokens that are important for ranking. A possible explanation for this phenomena is that the static embeddings for infrequent tokens is more informative (i.e., more helpful as side information) compared to static embeddings for frequent tokens (e.g., ‘the’). We also found AESI excels more in compressing nouns, verbs, and adjectives, while AE-2L excels more in compressing punctuations, determiners, and adpositions. Again, this demonstrate that the static embeddings is most helpful in encoding tokens that are crucial for ranking. The details of this evaluation appear in Appendix C."

While H is randomized and thus defines a distribution, when D is known, we abuse the notation and define the inverse Hadamard transform as H−1(x) := (H2kD)−1x = DH2kx.\nThe quantization operates as follows. Given a vector, denoted x ∈ Rd, we first precondition it using a randomized Hadamard transform,H, and normalize by multiplying by √ d/‖x‖2. There are several desired outcomes of this transform6. First, the dynamic range of the values is reduced (measured, for instance, by the ratio of the `∞ and the `2 norms). Loosely speaking, we can think of the transform as spreading the vector’s information evenly among its coordinates. Second, regardless of the distribution of the input vector, each coordinate of the transformed vector will have a distribution that is close to the standard Gaussian distribution (as an outcome of the central limit theorem). After the transform, we perform scalar quantization that is optimized for the N (0, 1) distribution, using K-means (also known as Max-Lloyd in the quantization literature (Gersho and Gray, 1992)), with K = 2B . The vector X of cluster assignments together with the original vector’s `2 norm can now be stored as the compressed representation of the original vector.\nTo retrieve an estimate of the original vector, we perform the same steps in reverse. We replace\n6We also note that the transform has the advantage of having a vectorized, in-place, O(d log d)-time implementation (Fino and Algazi, 1976).\nAlgorithm 1 B-bits Vector Quantization (DRIVE) (Vargaftik et al., 2021a)\nH - A randomized Hadamard transform c - K-Means centroids over the normal distribution, where K = 2B\nQuantize(x ∈ Rd): y := √ d\n‖x‖2 H(x)\nCompute Xi = argmink |yi − ck|: X ∈ {0, . . . , 2B − 1}d return X , ‖x‖2\nDequantize(X , ‖x‖2): Compute ŷi = cXi : ŷ ∈ {c0, . . . ,c2B−1}d return x̂ = H−1 ( ‖x‖2√ d ŷ )\nthe vector of cluster assignments X with a vector ŷ containing each assigned cluster’s centroid, denormalize, and then apply the inverse randomized Hadamard transform, H−1. To avoid encoding D directly, we recreate it using shared randomness (Newman, 1991) (e.g., a shared pseudorandom number generator seeded from a hash of the vector’s text).\nBlock-wise Quantization. The AESI encoder reduces the dimension of the contextual embeddings from hundreds (e.g., 384) to a much smaller number (e.g., 12). On the other hand, the randomized Hadamard transform’s preconditioning effect works best in higher dimensions (Ailon and Chazelle, 2006). In order to resolve this conflict, we first concatenate the reduced-dimension vectors of all the tokens from a single document. We then apply the Hadamard transform with a larger block size (e.g., 128) on the concatenated vector, blockby-block (padding the last block with zeros when necessary). When evaluating the compression efficiency, we consider the overhead incurred from (a) the need to store the vectors’ `2 norms and (b) the padding of the final Hadamard block in a concatenated vector. Balancing these factors should be done per use case. We empirically measured the padding overhead (for a block size of 128) for AESI 4, 8, 12, and 16 to be 20.1%, 9.7%, 6.7%, and 4.5% for the MSMARCO dataset and 41%, 18.5%, 12.5%, and 8.4% for the CAR dataset."

      "heading" : "B Quantization Evaluation",
      "text" : "To study the impact of quantization, we fix AESI16 as our baseline and measure how different quantization strategies and number of bits affect the MRR@10 score. Note that we do not measure quantization over the baseline BERTSPLIT since it can only achieve a compression ratio of up to 32x per coordinate (using 1 bit per coordinate). In addition to DRIVE (Appendix A, Algorithm 1), we consider the following quantization strategies:\nDeterministic Rounding (DR) (Gersho and Gray, 1992). Maps the input coordinates into the [0, 2B−1] range using min-max normalization and rounds to the nearest integer. Stochastic Rounding (SR) (Barnes et al., 1951; Connolly et al., 2021). Normalizes as before using min-max normalization, and additionally adds a uniform dither noise in (−0.5, 0.5) and then rounds to the nearest integer. This provides an unbiased estimate of each coordinate. Subtractive Dithering (SD) (Roberts, 1962; Gray and Stockham, 1993). Same as SR, only now before denormalization, instead of just using the values in {0, . . . , 2B − 1}, we first subtract the original dither noise, which we assume can be regenerated using shared randomness. This is an unbiased estimator with reduced variance. Hadamard Variants (H-DR, H-SR, and H-SD). These variants correspond to the previous methods; only they are preceded by a randomized Hadamard transform. DRIVE with Bias Correction (DRIVE-BC) (Vargaftik et al., 2021b, Appendix C.3). This variant of DRIVE optimizes for lower bias over the mean squared error (MSE) by multiplying the dequantization result in Algorithm 1 by a bias correction scalar: ‖x‖22 / ‖ŷ‖ 2 2 .\nFigure 4 shows the results for the different quantization methods. First, we observe that the Hadamard variants perform better than their nonHadamard counterparts. Second, we see that DRIVE performs better than all other schemes. The differences are more pronounced in the low-bit regime, where the choice of quantization scheme has a drastic impact on quality. We also note that unlike in other use cases, such as distributed mean estimation, bias correction is inappropriate here and should not be performed at the cost of increased mean squared error (MSE). This conclusion fol-\nlows by observing that DRIVE and the deterministic rounding methods (DR, H-DR) are respectively better than DRIVE-BC and the stochastic rounding methods (SR, H-SR). We add that the subtractive dithering methods (SD, H-SD), expectedly, work the same or better than their deterministic counterparts since they produce a similar MSE while also being unbiased.\nThe current quantization scheme requires padding to full 128 blocks. For AESI with a small code size, the padding overhead may reach 10% – 20% percent. In addition, we send a normalization value per 128-block, which we currently send as a float32 value, adding 4% – 5% additional overhead. Padding can be reduced by treating the last 128-block separately, e.g., applying a method that does not require Hadamard transform. Normalization overhead can be reduced, e.g., by sending normalization factors as float16 instead of full float32. However, such solutions complicate the implementation while providing limited storage benefits, hence, they were not explored in the context of this paper.\nBeyond Scalar Quantization. Scalar quantization using a fixed number of bits is a suboptimal technique in general since it does not allocate fewer bits for more frequent cases. Entropy coding(Gersho and Gray, 1992) can do better in this aspect. However, this improvement seems may not justify the added complexity: For the case of 6-bit quantization, the entropy of the quantization indices turned out to be 5.71bit, indicating that the compression gain is limited to about 5% in this case (even before accounting for the overhead incurred from the entropy coding algorithm itself). Additional directions include quantizing multiple values together (vector quantization), as well as designing the quantizer with entropy consideration in mind (entropy-constrained vector quantization). In order to estimate the potential gains of all these methods combined, we turn to information theory, and rate-distortion theory in particular, which studies the optimal tradeoffs between distortion and compression rate (Cover and Thomas, 2006). For a Gaussian source, which is a reasonable approximation of the vectors that are compressed in our case (following the randomized Hadamard transform), it is known that the optimal (lossy) compression rate is given by 12 log2( 1 MSE ), where MSE is the mean squared error of the compressed source. We computed the optimal rate that is achievable for the\nMSE that our system achieved for 6 bits, and the optimal rate was 5.35bit, indicating a potential gain of 11%. Given these results, and also given that for other bit rates the results were similar, we conclude that further quantization improvements have limited gain, which most likely does not justify the added system complexity.\nC Intrinsic Evaluation of AESI-Encoded Vectors\nIn the body of the paper, we showed the effectiveness in ranking and utility in compression rates of AESI over AE architectures. However, such evaluations do not capture the encoded information at the token-level. In this intrinsic evaluation we try to discern when and why adding the static embedding as side information contributes to better capturing the token meaning.\nWe study the effectiveness of different autoencoder configurations in reconstructing back the original token vector, as measured through the MSE between the original vector and the reconstructed vector:\nMSE (v,D (E(v, u), u)) ,\nwhere v is a contextualized vector (BERTSPLIT output at layer 10), u is the static embedding, and the encoder E(v, u) and the decoder D(e, u) are as defined in § 3.1. High MSE scores indicate the inability of the autoencoder to encode the original vector’s information.\nDocument Frequency: One way to assess the importance of a document w.r.t. a query is through\nthe inverse document frequency of query tokens, typically measured through TF-IDF or BM25 schemes (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009). In principle, the more infrequent a query token is in a document collection, the higher the ranking of a document containing that token will be. Tokens with (very) high frequencies are typically stop words or punctuation symbols, which have lower importance when determining the query-document relevance.\nBased on this premise, we study how MSE varies across token frequency. We selected a random sample of 256k documents from MSMARCO, tokenized them, and run them through BERTSPLIT to get 20M contextualized token representations. Then, for each token we measured their document frequency as DF (t) = log10(|{d ∈ D : t ∈ d}|/|D|) (where D is our document collection), and in Figure 5 we plot the average MSE against the rounded DF scores. From this experiment, we make the following observations.\nFirst, on all encoded width configurations, our approach, AESI, consistently achieves lower MSE compared to the AE architecture (for all DF values). Lower MSE correlates to a better ranking quality, as shown in § 5.3. Furthermore, for tokens with low DF, adding the static side information during the training of AESI for compression provides a huge advantage, which shrinks when the token is present in many documents in the collection.\nSecond, on the end spectrum of high-frequency tokens, we note a downwards trend for AE and\nan upwards trend for AESI, especially for DF ∈ [−1, 0]. The MSE decrease for AE is expected since the training data contains more frequent tokens. The increase for AESI can be explained given that in this frequency range, we deal with tokens that are function words (e.g., ‘the’) whose role is more in tying up content within a sentence and has less standalone meaning. In this case, static embeddings cannot capture context, which reduces the contribution provided by the side information."

    "abstractText" : "BERT based ranking models have achieved superior performance on various information retrieval tasks. However, the large number of parameters and complex self-attention operations come at a significant latency overhead. To remedy this, recent works propose late-interaction architectures, which allow precomputation of intermediate document representations, thus reducing latency. Nonetheless, having solved the immediate latency issue, these methods now introduce storage costs and network fetching latency, which limit their adoption in real-life production systems. In this work, we propose the Succinct Document Representation (SDR) scheme that computes highly compressed intermediate document representations, mitigating the storage/network issue. Our approach first reduces the dimension of token representations by encoding them using a novel autoencoder architecture that uses the document’s textual content in both the encoding and decoding phases. After this token encoding step, we further reduce the size of the document representations using modern quantization techniques. Evaluation on MSMARCO’s passage rereranking task show that compared to existing approaches using compressed document representations, our method is highly efficient, achieving 4x–11.6x higher compression rates for the same ranking quality. Similarly, on the TREC CAR dataset, we achieve 7.7x higher compression rate for the same ranking quality.",
