      "text" : "All our words are but crumbs that fall down from the feast of the mind (Gibran, 1926). When humans read such a metaphorical phrase, how do they interpret it? Conceptual metaphors structure our everyday language and are used to map everyday physical experiences and emotions onto abstract concepts (Lakoff and Johnson, 1981). They allow us to communicate complex ideas, to emphasize emotions, and to make humorous statements (Fussell and Moss, 2008). However, despite relating words in a way that differs from their accepted definition, these phrases are readily interpreted by human listeners, and are common in discourse (Shutova, 2011), occurring on average every three sentences (Mio and Katz, 1996; Fussell and Moss, 2008)\nThe ability to interpret figurative language has been viewed as a bottleneck in natural language understanding, but it has not been studied as widely as\n1Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ metaphor-qa-5083/ under the MIT license.\nliteral language (Shutova, 2011; Tong et al., 2021). Figurative language often relies on shared commonsense or cultural knowledge, and in some cases may be difficult to solve using language statistics. This presents a challenge to language models (LMs), as strong LMs trained only on text may not be able to make sense of the physical world, nor the social or cultural knowledge that language is grounded in (Bender and Koller, 2020; Bisk et al., 2020).\nMost previous work on figurative language focuses on metaphor detection, where a model is trained to identify the existence of metaphors in text (Tsvetkov et al., 2014; Stowe and Palmer, 2018; Leong et al., 2020), with datasets consisting mostly of conventionalized metaphors and idioms in wide use. However, identifying these common metaphors that already appear often in language may be an easy task for LMs, and not fully test their ability to interpret figurative language. The little work that exists on metaphor interpretation frames it as a task linking metaphorical phrases to literal rewordings, either through paraphrase detection (Bizzoni and Lappin, 2018) or paraphrase generation (Shutova, 2010; Su et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2018) (details in § 7) While interesting, this work does not take into account the fact that metaphors are rich with different implications that may vary depending on the context.\nIn this work, we ask whether or not LMs can correctly make inferences regarding creative, relatively novel metaphors generated by humans. This task is harder for two reasons: (1) inference is harder than identification or paraphrasing, as it requires understanding the underlying semantics, and (2) the metaphors in our dataset are novel creations, and many may not appear even once in the LMs’ training data. We propose a minimal task inspired by the Winograd schema (Levesque et al., 2012), where LMs are tasked with choosing the entailed phrase from two opposite metaphorical phrases. An example of a paired sentence is \"Her\ncommitment is as sturdy as (plywood/oak)\". The correct answer would be either \"She was (committed/uncommitted)\". This can also be seen as an entailment task, where input x is the premise, and the output y is the hypothesis.2\nWe crowdsource a benchmark Fig-QA, consisting of 10,256 such metaphors and implications (§ 2), which can be used to evaluate the nonliteral reasoning abilities of LMs or for more broad studies of figurative language in general (we provide preliminary analyses in § 3). Through extensive experiments over strong pre-trained LMs (§ 4), we find that although they can be fine-tuned to do reasonably well, their few-shot performance falls significantly short of human performance (§ 5). An indepth analysis (§ 6) uncovers several insights: (1) LMs do not make use of the metaphorical context well, instead relying on the probability of interpretations alone, (2) the task of associating a metaphor with an interpretation is more difficult than the reverse, (3) even strong models such as GPT-3 make inexplicable errors that are not well-aligned with human ones, indicating that further work is needed to properly model nonliteral language."

Some examples of generated pairs are displayed in Table 1.\nIn order to help workers, we employ the randomness as genesis and narrow limits of change principles of Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 2006).

Interpretation involves inferring an attribute of the subject by extracting a relational attribute from the object (Fauconnier and Turner, 2003). In a simile, R is explicit, whereas it is usually implicit in a metaphor. The most common subjects, relations, and objects in the medium train dataset are shown in Figure 1.

Some visual metaphors also sketched a vivid visual scene. These examples comprised 14.73% of the test set.\nCommon-sense social understanding examples required knowing about how humans would react in different circumstances, or required knowing about human emotions.

As such, we can directly compute the probability of a sentence by multiplying the conditional probability of each token at every time step.\nP̃ (w1...wN ) = p(w1) N∏ i=2 p(wi|w1...wi−1)\nThe ability to directly extract probabilities enables the zero-shot reasoning of these LMs. For a pair of metaphorical expressions x1 and x2 with two corresponding interpretations y1 and y2, we feed in the concatenation of the metaphor and the interpretation to the pretrained model without finetuning. We define “forward” and “backward” probabilities assigned to interpretations and figurative language expressions, respectively. For the forward probability, for figurative phrase xi and correct answer yi, we take\nP (yi|xi) = P (xi, yi)\nP (xi, yi) + P (xi, yj)\nsince there are only two answer options. From this, we can calculate accuracy when we taking the indicator of P (yi|xi) > 0.5. Similarly for the backward probability (predicting phrase based on answer), we take\nP (xi|yi) = P (xi, yi)\nP (xi, yi) + P (xj , yi)\nwith analogous backward accuracy.3\nWe examine three state-of-the-art large transformer-based LMs of this category: GPT-2 (with 117M parameters, trained on 40GB of text), GPT-neo (with 1.3B parameters, trained on 800GB of text) and GPT-3 (4 variants between 350M and 175B parameters, trained on 45TB on text) (Radford et al., 2019; Black et al., 2021; Brown et al., 2020). We also examine the performance of these models after finetuning on the training data. GPT-2 and GPT-neo were trained with a batch size of 8, with early stopping on the medium dataset with a patience of 1 epoch, and a minimal hyperparameter search was done with learning rates 1e-5 to 5e-5. GPT-3 was trained with the default parameters of the GPT-3 finetuning API.\n3In actuality, we use the length-normalized probability that a model assigns to a sentence as a heuristic for the total probability, to minimize the effect that the length of a sentence has on the decision (though this is not the probability of the sequence in a strict sense): P (w1...wN ) = exp(− 1\nN log P̃ (w1...wN )). Initial experimentation showed\nmarginal differences in accuracy when using these two methods, so we used normalized probabilities by default."

      "text" : "We also evaluate the performance of masked LMs on this task. Unlike auto-regressive LMs, masked LMs cannot directly output the probability of a sentence, so it is not possible to directly test the zero-shot performance of these models. Instead, we test the transfer performance by first finetuning them in two ways: on WinoGrande, which is also a binary choice task based on commonsense reasoning, and on several NLI datasets, including SNLI, MNLI, FEVER-NLI and ANLI (Nie et al., 2020; Sakaguchi et al., 2020). The input to the model trained on WINOGRANDE is formatted as [CLS][metaphor][SEP] [answer1][SEP][answer2], and we use an extra linear layer on the [CLS] token embedding to perform the classification. In addition to the transfer performance, we also use contrastive finetuning by feeding in each metaphor along with both answer choices, and training the model with our dataset to classify which answer is correct. For the NLI model, we examine accuracy using all three labels the model was originally trained with (entailment, neutral, and contradiction), as well as using a forced binary choice paradigm in which the logits for the contradiction label are subtracted from the logits for the entailment label, and the higher \"entailment score\" is the ending the model predicts. We treat these two conditions as the analog of “zero-shot\" for these models.\nWe examine two masked LMs that are commonly used as baselines on many NLP tasks: BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), a transformer-based LM jointly trained on the masked LM and next sentence prediction objectives, and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), an improved variant of BERT which consistently outperforms BERT across most tasks. We use the large variant of both models (350M parameters). BERT and RoBERTa were finetuned on the medium dataset for 8 epochs with batch size 8, following the setting in (Sakaguchi et al., 2020). A hyperparameter search was done with learning rates 5e-6 to 2e-5. Both BERT and RoBERTa were used for the Winogrande experiments, while only\nRoBERTa was used for the NLI experiment."

Participants were mainly graduate student volunteers.\nWe shuffled the test set and split it into 10 partitions of ≈115 examples for each annotator.

These results are presented in Table 4. The results for masked language models are higher than those for autoregressive language models, and fine-tuning significantly improves performance for all models.\nZero-shot Performance For the zero-shot setting, we examine the test accuracy based on zeroshot forward probabilities for the GPT models, and\n4This is the accuracy score when transferring from Winogrande. Pretrained NLI results were 50.47 when using original labels (entailment/contradiction/neutral), and 66.32 when forcing a binary decision.\nthe pseudo \"zero-shot\" transfer performance for BERT and RoBERTa using models pretrained on the WinoGrande task (Sakaguchi et al., 2020). As shown, the GPT-3 models outperform the GPT-2 and GPT-neo models. Among the GPT-3 models, there is a clear correlation between model size and performance, with the largest model (GPT-3 Davinci) achieving the highest zero-shot test accuracy. BERT and RoBERTa achieve accuracies within the range of GPT-3 models. While our models mostly perform much better than chance in the zero-shot setting, there is still a large gap of 26 percentage points between our best model and human level performance.\nFine-tuned Performance For the fine-tuned setting, all listed models are fine-tuned on the small dataset split. GPT models were trained with language modeling loss, whereas BERT and RoBERTa are trained with contrastive loss. We did not evaluate fine-tuning of GPT-3 Davinci due to budget. Overall, fine-tuning improved accuracy significantly for all models, with GPT-3 models uniformly improving by about 13 percentage points, and BERT/RoBERTa improving by about 25 points. Our best model after fine-tuning is RoBERTa, which reaches within 5% of our human performance.\nPrompting We also experiment with prompting methods. Firstly, we use a simple suffix prompting method, where we simply append the phrase \"that is to say\" between the metaphor and the interpretation, which we hypothesized may \"explain\" to the LM that the previous statement is figurative. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the examples method, by appending k random correct metaphor/interpretation pairs before the actual pair we are testing. The results of these experiments can be seen in Figure 2. We found that the suffix method provided a small (1-2%) improvement over the baseline, while the example method was generally ineffective.\nBackward accuracies Note the accuracies reported in this section are for the forward direction, and the backward direction is reported in Appendix C. Backward accuracies are lower, with GPT-3 Curie for example having a 7% reduction in accuracy in the zero-shot case. This suggests that selecting a metaphorical expression to match a literal phrase is more challenging than the reverse for LMs."

Given the difficulty of evaluating text generation, compounded by the difficulty of figurative language, we opted for manual evaluation of one tenth of the test dataset using generations of the strongest auto-regressive model: GPT-3 Davinci (≈175B parameters).\nThe metaphor was given as input to the model, and 4 completions were generated for each metaphor, with a maximum length of 100 tokens. Suffix prompting was also used because of the lack of context, with \"That is to say, \" appended to each metaphor. Only the first sentence of the output was evaluated. The temperature parameter was determined through grid search through values [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1] on a small separate set of metaphors. A human annotator inspected the generated completions and found that a temperature of 0.4 produced the most correct results.\nThree paper authors labelled completions generated by GPT-3 Davinci as either correct, incorrect, or literal. In some cases, there were valid interpretations that were not the same as the answer given by crowdworkers, which were also marked correct. If the model simply restated the metaphor with no interpretation, the completion was marked as literal. Because some metaphors are ambiguous when presented without context, those examples were not counted. The inter-rater reliability was moderate due to differing standards for correctness (Krippendorff’s α = 0.5567). The majority vote was taken between annotators’ judgments.\nGPT-3 Davinci’s accuracy, counting literalized metaphors as incorrect, was 50.8%. Not counting literalized metaphors, accuracy was 63.9%. In 37.7% of cases, GPT-3 generated contradictory completions among the 4 completions. There was\nat least one correct completion for 78.1% of the metaphors, but only 19.3% of metaphors had all completions correct. Examples of annotated generations can be found in Appendix F."

We find that autoregressive models rely on the probability of each answer by itself to predict the answer, and that this holds true for all models, before and after training. We find that models have difficulty in interpreting \"sarcastic\" metaphors, and sometimes inexplicably interpret very simple metaphors wrong. We also examine error typology according to the commonsense typology of § 3.2 and find that models improve significantly on object, visual and social commonsense when trained, but not on cultural commonsense."

      "heading" : "6.1 Reliance on Probability of Answers",
      "text" : "We find that models often rely solely on the probability of answers y1 and y2 to make their predictions, regardless of the context. This led models to make the same prediction for the paired sentences in many cases. Figure 3 and Table 5 show that this trend improves with fine-tuning, and that GPT-3 is best able to disentangle the probability of yi and the probability of P (yi|xi), but all three models show a heavy tendency to predict based on the relative probability of an answer alone.\nWe hypothesize that this may be one reason why BERT and RoBERTa achieve the best finetuned performance; they use a contrastive finetuning strategy providing both the correct and incorrect options as input to the model. On the other hand, the GPT models were finetuned with only the correct option, making the comparison unfair. One way to finetune GPT models contrastively is to include both options into a cleverly engineered prompt, but we leave this as a direction for future work."

We examined accuracy by part of speech patterns in each part of the metaphor, as well as by wordnet hypernyms present in each part of the metaphor. This is detailed in Appendix D and Appendix E (Fellbaum, 1998). We used NLTK for POS tagging (Loper and Bird, 2002)."

      "text" : "Common Sense Knowledge We first examine the error tendencies by the type of common sense knowledge described in § 3.2. Table 6 summarizes accuracies for these types of commonsense questions compared to humans.\nWe find that both humans and trained models tend to find object commonsense and visual commonsense metaphors easier to interpret. We find that as models improve, most of the performance gain comes from the object, visual and social commonsense categories. Interestingly, the untrained models do quite well on cultural examples, but do not improve much on the culture category when trained. This makes sense, as the cultural examples tend to be quite disparate, so training would not help as much with other examples.\nSarcastic Metaphors For both humans and LMs, many of the errors are \"sarcastic\" metaphors, such as saying \"the girl was as bubbly as still water\" to mean \"the girl was bland\", rather than \"the girl was vivacious\". These sentences can be difficult if the model or human focuses on simple word association (bubbly with vivacious) without reading the entire sentence to understand the sarcasm.\nInexplicable Errors We examined the errors made by GPT-3 Curie (trained) and found that there was little overlap with mistakes made by humans. Of the 64 human errors, 13 were also errors made by GPT-3. GPT-3 made many more \"obvious\" errors, such as predicting \"The ball is a big red sun\" to mean \"the ball is small\" rather than \"the ball is big and red\" This is in contrast to the sentences in\nwhich humans made errors, which often contained rare vocabulary or unfamiliar cultural references."

Two shared tasks on metaphor identification have been run (Leong et al., 2018, 2020). Both have utilized the VUA corpus, and the latter also introduced the TOEFL corpus, sampled from essays written by non-native English speakers (Leong et al., 2020; Beigman Klebanov et al., 2018). Most participants in the shared tasks used neural models, notably BERT, RoBERTa, and Bi-LSTMs (Leong et al., 2020; Bizzoni and Ghanimifard, 2018; Gao et al., 2018; Pramanick et al., 2018). These models are generally improved when augmented with semantic data, such as concreteness, and multimodal information.\nDespite the utility of these tasks and datasets, they have drawbacks. Most of the metaphor use is conventional, so this task does not capture novel metaphors well. The word-level annotation also does not lend itself well to capturing extended conceptual metaphors.

This may be because certain words serve as a dual reference, which is to say they refer simultaneously to a physical referent and an abstract superordinate category (Glucksberg, 2003). For instance, \"shark\" may refer to literal sharks, as well as anything that is considered vicious, leading to utterances such as \"that lawyer is a shark\".\nMetaphorical language processing has also been studied in second-language learners, in the case of idioms. In most cases, the meaning of an unfamiliar idiom is inferred from the context or from word association (Cooper, 1999; Carston and Wearing, 2011; Wolff and Gentner, 2000).\nAs LMs excel at word-association based tasks, this is an encouraging finding.

Given that metaphorical reasoning may play a role in problem-solving and linguistic creativity, the development of models, training methods, or datasets that enable metaphorical reasoning may improve models’ abilities to reason creatively and draw analogies between situations that may appear to be different on the surface. One avenue we hope to investigate is multimodal metaphors, as this dataset currently includes only text-based metaphors. Nonliteral expressions also remain understudied cross-linguistically, but further work on identifying and interpreting metaphors in other languages may also improve the abilities of multilingual models."

      "text" : "We crowdsource metaphorical expressions and their interpretations through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Workers were recruited from the United States and were limited to those who had a > 98% approval rating on the platform, and who had also completed more than 1000 Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). Data collection was split into two stages: in the first stage, 1458 train examples, and all the dev and test examples were collected. In the second stage, the remaining 6558 training examples were collected. We identified some workers who created especially good examples in the first stage, and recruited them back for more examples in the second stage. Workers were paid $0.33 for each pair of sentences and were asked to generate 3 pairs at a time. An author of this paper wrote an initial pilot set of sentences, and timed themselves while writing some sentences. They found that each pair took around 1 minute to write, though this varied (less creative examples took less time, while more creative examples took more time). This extrapolates to an hourly rate of 19.80 USD, which is above the minimum wage in all US states, where workers were located.\nOur HIT task was structured as follows: At the top of the page, the workers are shown the following instructions: \"Your task is to generate three pairs of sentences with opposite or very different meanings, both of which contain rare/creative metaphors, which means metaphors that would not appear often in text on the internet, books, social media or news sites, but that can still be easily understood by people. For each metaphor, you should also provide a literal (non-metaphorical) sentence with the same meaning.\" Then, we display one example of a valid sentence pair. There is a button that opens a modal with more detailed instructions and some more valid/invalid examples for reference. Below that, we display three random words, which workers are encouraged to use in their sentences if they get stuck. Finally, we display three sets of 5 text fields for workers to fill in: one for the start phrase, two for each metaphorical phrase, and two for each literal interpretation. As the user types in each start phrase, we prepend a copy of their phrase before the corresponding metaphor fields in the UI using some embedded JavaScript, which we found helped reduce confusion and resulted in less improperly formatted responses.\nWe launched many batches of these HITs until\nwe had collected the desired quantity of data. Then, we converted the form responses into sentence pairs and validated each pair by hand before adding it to our dataset.\nB Invalid Examples\nFigurative language examples collected from crowdworkers were excluded if they (a) did not make sense given the meaning and the metaphorical expression, (b) had grammar or spelling errors that rendered them unintelligible, or (c) did not follow the format specified by the task template.\nEfforts were made to ensure that the final dataset contains no offensive content or personally identifiable information. WorkerID and other potentailly personally identifying information were not included."

However, figurative language has been a relatively under-studied area in NLP, and it remains an open question to what extent modern language models can interpret nonliteral phrases. To address this question, we introduce Fig-QA, a Winograd-style nonliteral language understanding task consisting of correctly interpreting paired figurative phrases with divergent meanings. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art language models on this task, and find that although language models achieve performance significantly over chance, they still fall short of human performance, particularly in zeroor few-shot settings. This suggests that further work is needed to improve the nonliteral reasoning capabilities of language models.1",
