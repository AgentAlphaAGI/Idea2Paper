      "text" : "Negation is an important linguistic phenomenon that appears commonly in natural language but is underrepresented in common NLP benchmarks (Hossain et al., 2020). Furthermore, the Checklist benchmark (Ribeiro et al., 2020) shows that most sentiment analyzers and machine comprehension models struggle with samples containing negation. Negation is even more important in biomedical domain text, where patients are carefully defined as having/not having specific characteristics. Even within the biomedical domain, there are many types of text such as clinical notes, lab reports, or research publications, each with particular characteristics in relation to the use of negation. A recent work on negation detection in English texts found that negation detection models do not transfer well across domains, due to variations in expression of negation (Khandelwal and Sawant, 2020). It remains a challenge to solve negation in general, even with state-of-the-art NLP models.\nNegation detection is typically defined as consisting of the two sub-tasks of: (1) cue detection,\ndetecting the cue phrase that triggers the negation; and (2) scope resolution, determining the affected spans that are negated. Three primary datasets are used to evaluate negation; the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008) includes full papers and abstracts of biological papers, the SFU corpus (Konstantinova et al., 2012) is a collection of product reviews, and the Sherlock dataset (Morante and Blanco, 2012) consists of short literary works. There are differences in annotation schemes across the datasets, such as whether or not the cues are included inside scope annotation, and sub-optimal cross-dataset results have been observed, providing clear indications that the datasets are highly divergent in language use and negation types.\nIn this work, we aim to extend the transfer learning capability of NegBERT (Khandelwal and Sawant, 2020) through additional pre-training with task-related augmented training data, and a new masking objective. Our contributions are:\n• We introduce an approach to augmenting data to emphasize negation in pre-training. • We propose a novel extension to the standard random masked language model objective in pre-training to explicitly mask negation cues, to make the models more robust to negation. • We conduct extensive experiments on different benchmarks to evaluate cross-domain performance of large pre-trained language models as well as the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training strategies; code available at http://ANONYMISED."

      "text" : "To date, negation detection has been heavily-reliant on rule-based systems. Chapman et al. (2001) proposed a simple system, NegEx, based on regular expressions to detect negation cues in a sentence given a concept of interest (the scope). NegEx remains the most popular approach to negation detection, especially in the clinical domain where\ntarget clinical concepts can be detected (e.g., with MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010)). Further research has extended NegEx with syntactic information (Mehrabi et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2018), and shown that rule-based systems can achieve relatively good performance for detecting negation, especially in the biomedical domain, but do not generalize well to other domains or datasets.\nTo approach negation cue and negation scope detection with supervised machine learning, two classification tasks are defined: finding negation tokens and classifying tokens as the first or last (or neither) token within the scope of negation. Most works follow a common scheme in extracting various features from the sentence, in using a classifier to classify each token as the beginning, inside, or outside of a negation cue or scope span (Morante and Daelemans, 2009; Ou and Patrick, 2015; Cruz et al., 2016). Recently, research has shifted to applying deep learning methods to the task. Most approaches make use of RNN-based architectures to encode the input sentences, combined with a softmax layer for classification (Lazib et al., 2019; Chen, 2019). Despite the high performance on common benchmarks, results are biased by the fact that negation scope is often delimited by punctuation and other dataset artefacts (Fancellu et al., 2017). As such, they are potentially only learning domain-specific surface features rather than capturing the true semantics of negation. NegBERT applies a large pre-trained language model to the problem of negation detection, outperforming previous deep learning methods on negation detection, with especially high gains on scope resolution."

      "heading" : "3.1 Negation-focused data collection",
      "text" : "We aim to construct a dataset that is enriched for negation, to support negation-sensitized pretraining of large language models. To obtain sentences with negations, we extend the NegEx lexicon with additional negation cues obtained from biomedical texts (Morante, 2010), and apply it to\nsentences extracted from a corpus using the SpaCy English sentence tokenizer, keeping only those sentences with at least one identified negation.\nFor the biomedical domain, we use texts in the TREC-CDS 2021 snapshot1 of the clinical trials registry.2 Clinical trials are documents describing the protocols and relevant patient characteristics of a clinical research study. Description of clinical trials can be quite long, but a core aspect of the trial description is the patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, specifying what types of characteristics or conditions a patient must have/not have in order to be suitable for the trial. The reasons for choosing this data are that: (1) it is in-domain for the biomedical domain; (2) the texts are well-formed sentences with proper grammatical structure; and (3) the texts contain many negations, especially in the inclusion/exclusion criteria sections. For the general domain, we apply this approach to wikitext (Merity et al., 2016), a set of verified articles in Wikipedia. We sample the data equally from these two sets, obtaining 1, 381, 948 negation sentences."

      "heading" : "3.2 Negation-focused pre-training",
      "text" : "Adaptive pre-training on target domain data has been shown to be an effective strategy for domain adaptation (Gururangan et al., 2020). We therefore hypothesize that pre-training language models on text with negations will help the model incorporate information about negation, and learn better representation for sentences containing negation. Using the negation-focused data, we first apply the standard random word masking strategy (Devlin et al., 2019) and train the model with the masked language model objective.\nAs part of the collection of the negation-focused data, we obtain predictions of negation cues in all the sentences, which can be explicitly incorporated to make the model more robust to negation. Inspired by various works on entity and span masking (Joshi et al., 2020; Yamada et al., 2020), we explore explicitly incorporating information about negation cues into the model by masking these cues, and targeting prediction of the masked cue in the pre-training stage. Below is an example of how a sentence is tokenized under our masking scheme: No serious complications such as hypertension, diabetes. ⇒ [CUE] serious complications such as [MASK], diabetes.\n1http://www.trec-cds.org/2021.html 2http://ClinicalTrials.gov\nA new type of token [CUE] is introduced under this masking scheme, and the model needs to reconstruct the original sentence by predicting both the [CUE] token to be No, and the randomlymasked token [MASK] to be hypertension. By always masking negation cues in all the sentences, we force the model to focus more on this type of token, and thus, aim to learn better embeddings incorporating information of how a negation cue is represented in the context of the sentence. Moreover, by using a different token to mask negation cues, we ensure that the model learns to distinguish between different types of tokens. In this work, we replace the BERT encoder of NegBERT with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and apply whole-word masking, meaning that all the sub-word tokens that constitute a word will be masked."

      "heading" : "4.1 Experimental settings",
      "text" : "Following the experiment settings in NegBERT, we use the three standard benchmarks for negation cue detection and scope resolution tasks, i.e. BioScope (Vincze et al., 2008) (separated into two subsets, sourced from abstracts and full-text papers, resp.), the SFU product reviews dataset (Konstantinova et al., 2012), and the Sherlock dataset (Morante and Blanco, 2012). In addition, we use the negationannotated subset of VetCompass UK3 (Cheng et al., 2017), consisting of clinical notes in the veterinary domain, which are very informal compared to BioScope. It also contains abbreviations and shortening of terms, as well as certain unique negation cues. To investigate the cross-domain performance, we perform cue detection and scope resolution for all 4 datasets, based on training on one dataset and evaluating on all datasets. Detailed statistics of these datasets are presented in Table 1.\nWe formulate the two tasks as sequence labeling problems, where each token is tagged with a corresponding label. For cue detection, we use the annotation scheme {0: Affix, 1: Normal Cue, 2: Part of multiword cue, 3: Not part of cue}. For scope resolution, we use gold cue information and two labels {0: Outside negation scope, 1: Part of negation scope}. We adopt the same hyperparameters as NegBERT. Following the standard evaluation scheme in previous negation detection works, all systems are evaluated using token-level F1-score, based on whether it is inside or outside of any\n3https://www.rvc.ac.uk/VetCOMPASS\nnegation cue or scope. Methods evaluated include: (1) NegBERT; (2) AugNB: NegBERT plus pretraining on negation-focused data; and (3) CueNB: NegBERT plus pre-training on negation-focused data and the negation cue masking objective."

      "heading" : "4.2 Main results",
      "text" : "Tables 2 and 3 report the performance of negation cue detection and negation scope resolution, respectively. Results reported are the average of 5 runs with different random seeds. NegBERT results are produced using the official implementation.4\nWe observe similar trends across all datasets for both cue detection and scope resolution. Regarding the in-dataset setting (training and evaluating on the same dataset), AugNB outperforms the baseline NegBERT on all datasets except for Sherlock. Gains are more noticeable in the biomedical datasets (BioScope, VetCompass). For Sherlock, however, we observe a slight degradation in performance with the proposed pre-training scheme. This is likely due to the fact that Sherlock has major differences in annotation scheme compared to other corpora, specifically including scopes to the left of cues, while in BioScope and SFU, the scope is usually annotated only to the right of cues. Also, the cue itself is not considered to be part of the scope in Sherlock or SFU, unlike in BioScope.\nIn the cross-dataset setting, we record gains across all benchmarks. The largest cross-dataset improvements over NegBERT are for SFU, perhaps due to SFU being the largest dataset in size, containing a relatively large number of unique cues. CueNB further improves the performance of AugNB, confirming our hypothesis that explicitly masking the cue will help the model learn better representations for negation cues and thus, better distinguish between cues and normal words. These results show that our negation-focused pre-training strategy is effective for improving the transfer learning performance of pre-trained language models on the negation detection task.\n4https://github.com/adityak6798/ Transformers-For-Negation-and-Speculation"

      "heading" : "4.3 Discussion",
      "text" : "We conduct an error analysis on the VetCompass validation set to see what qualitative improvement CueNB makes over NegBERT. For cue detection, there are two main types of errors that CueNB helps alleviate. First, CueNB can detect more unique cues such as negative, won’t, and also multiword cues like no longer. Second, CueNB is able to recognize cases when the negations are actually just speculative. For example, in the sentence O reports has smelled for past week, not sure if anal glands ..., not is actually part of speculation phrase not sure, indicating that this is not a negation. For scope resolution, CueNB mostly helps in recognizing the correct scope boundary. One common case is when the cue relates to multiple spans in a sentence. In the sentence Examination: QAR, thorac ausc and abdo palp NAD,5 NegBERT only recognizes the nearest span abdo palp NAD to be the scope, whereas CueNB recognizes the full correct span thorac ausc and abdo palp NAD. It also helps in cases where there are multiple separate negations in the same sentence. For instance, in the sentence No V+ or no D+., No V+ and no D+ are two independent negation scope spans, whereas NegBERT would recognize the whole sentence as one span. Another interesting case is when there are exceptions in the sentence, e.g. the No. . . other than . . . construction. For No probs detected other than the skin lesions, CueNB is able to recognize the correct scope No probs detected while NegBERT considers the whole sentence to be the scope.\nWe also conduct an ablation study to understand the impact of each component of the proposed pre-\n5NAD is the negation cue no abnormality detected\ntraining strategy. Table 4 presents the results of different variations of the proposed pre-training scheme on the BioScope-Abstract validation split. We consider two variations, pre-training with: (1) only the negation-focused data (equivalent to the AugNB model); and (2) only the cue masking objective. To model the latter variation, we explicitly mask the cue in the BioScope training set, then pretrain on this training set. From the results, we see that both strategies help improve the baseline NegBERT on cue detection and scope resolution, with explicitly masking the cues being the most important. Combining both strategies (CueNB) further improves the overall results."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this work, we propose a new negation-focused pre-training strategy to explicitly incorporate negation information into pre-trained language models. Empirical results on common benchmarks show that the proposed strategy helps improve the performance of pre-trained language models on the negation detection task when evaluating on the same source dataset, as well as their transferability to target data in different domains. Despite the gains over previous methods, the sub-optimal results on some benchmarks show that negation remains a big challenge in NLP."

Recent works show that state-of-the-art NLP models underperform on samples containing negation in various tasks, and that negation detection models do not transfer well across domains. We propose a new negation-focused pre-training strategy, involving targeted data augmentation and negation masking, to better incorporate negation information into language models. Extensive experiments on common benchmarks show that our proposed approach improves negation detection performance and generalizability over the strong baseline NegBERT (Khandelwal and Sawant, 2020).",
