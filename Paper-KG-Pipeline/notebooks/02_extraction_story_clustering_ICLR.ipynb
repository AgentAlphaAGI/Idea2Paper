      "  \"abstract\": \"Errors in labels obtained via human annotation adversely affect a trained model's performance. Existing approaches propose ways to mitigate the effect of label error on a model's downstream accuracy, yet little is known about its impact on a model's group-based disparity metrics\\\\footnote{Group-based disparity metrics like subgroup calibration, false positive rate, false negative rate, equalized odds, and equal opportunity are more often known, colloquially, as \\\\textit{fairness metrics} in the literature. We use the term group-based disparity metrics in this work.}. Here we study the effect of label error on a model's group-based disparity metrics like group calibration. We empirically characterize how varying levels of label error, in both training and test data, affect these disparity metrics. We find that group calibration and other metrics are sensitive to train-time and test-time label error---particularly for minority groups. For the same level of label error, the percentage change in group calibration error for the minority group is on average 1.5 times larger than the change for the majority group. Towards mitigating the impact of training-time label error, we present an approach to estimate how changing a single training input's label affects a model's group disparity metric on a test set. We empirically assess the proposed approach on a variety of datasets and find a 10-40\\\\% improvement, compared to alternative approaches, in identifying training inputs that improve a model's disparity metric. The proposed approach can help surface training inputs that may need to be corrected for improving a model's group-based disparity metrics.\",\n",

We provide additional clarification here.\\\\n\\\\n___\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Difference from the Koh et. al. (Understanding black-box predictions via influence functions)**\\\\n>The technical results in this paper seem highly dependent on the previous paper \\\\\\\"Understanding black-box predictions via influence functions\\\\\\\". Specifically, From Eq (1) to Eq. (3), all the results are proposed by the previous paper.\\\\n\\\\n**Answer**: The reviewer is correct that Eqns 1-3 are due to Koh et. al. We do not claim these as contributions; we provide these to aid the reader. Our key contributions in that section are Eqns 4-5. We now provide additional clarification.\\\\n\\\\nIn using influence functions, our goal is to: 1) identify training samples whose *label have a high influence on any disparity metric of interest (e.g. group calibration, false positive rate, false negative rate, etc.)*, and 2) propose a method to improve these disparity metrics via relabeling. \\\\n\\\\nIn Koh et. al., they propose the influence functions to rank training samples that have a high influence on 1) the parameters, and 2) a single test example's loss or prediction. We extend these results to fairness metrics. To reinforce our point that such an extension is needed, the results of Fig. 5 demonstrate that a direct application of the original influence functions approach does not capture group-based effects that is often key for improving fairness metrics.\\\\n\\\\nEqns 4 and 5 directly address these challenges, and allow us to repurpose influence functions for addressing *fairness* challenges. Our presentation in Section 4 is sparse, due to space constraints.  However, we will add a paragraph to more clearly discuss these key differences. We will also expand the derivation in the Appendix to more clearly show these differences as well. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**A note about the relabel-and-finetune scheme**\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe saw a previous comment about the relabeling portion of the paper. To clarify, we have now compared to schemes like DivideMix and MEIDTM. We discuss these results in Sections 3.3 (Noise-aware robust learning has disparate impact) and 5.1(Identifying label error) in the updated draft. \\\\n\\\\nA point of caution first, since our setting requires sensitive group variables, we cannot directly use Cifar-10 and Cifar-100. We modify Cifar-10, as we discussed in the part 1 of the previous comment, to inject group annotations. In these experiments we make two important findings: \\\\n\\\\n1. Previous relabeling methods provide improvements for the majority group in the data, but not the minority group;\\\\n2. Our proposed group-based relabelling scheme outperforms these approaches since it directly identifies minority samples whose label have a high effect on that group's disparity metric. \\\\n\\\\nThese two findings demonstrate that our proposed scheme provides benefits that current approaches donot address.\\\\n\\\\n**Theorem 1 is trivial**\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe respectfully disagree with this opinion; the insight of theorem is obvious---in hindsight. However, we agree with the reviewer that the theorem's takeaway that if one relabels mislabeled examples, on a group basis, it leads to an improvement in group calibration is not surprising.\\\\n\\\\nIn a previous result, Kong et al. show that if one relabels by influence, the *average* validation loss, across all samples, of the fine-tuned model is reduced. However, as we discussed earlier, prioritization by generic influence favors the majority group, so it is not obvious that relabeling should improve **group calibration**, even for the minority group. In addition, the relationship between group calibration and the average validation loss is unclear. The key insight here is a way to relate a per-group average loss to that group's calibration. We are currently unaware of any previous result that demonstrates this point. Even though the theorem's result is not surprising, it does provide justification for the scheme we proposed. \\\\n\\\\nWe thank the reviewer again for the feedback, and we will be happy to answer any additional questions that you have.\\\", \\\"overall_score\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"confidence\\\": null, \\\"technical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"empirical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"correctness\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"clarity_quality_novelty_reproducibility\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"recommendation\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"tldr\\\": \\\"\\\"}, {\\\"review_id\\\": \\\"s6df0K3WSU\\\", \\\"paper_id\\\": \\\"RUzSobdYy0V\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\": null, \\\"paper_summary\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"strengths\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"weaknesses\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"comments\\\": \\\"Dear Authors,\\\\n\\\\nThank you very much for the response.

In addition to the general updates, we address your concerns here.\\\\n___\\\\n\\\\n**Reliability of Empirical Conclusions**\\\\\\\\\\\\nAs we note in the general comment, our results and findings hold even as we expand to several other datasets. The consistency of the results across these datasets suggests that our conclusion is not dataset dependent. We have now added additional datasets and suggestive theoretical insights that indicate that our findings are not an artifact due to a specific experimental or dataset setting. \\\\n\\\\n**Label Flipping:** We agree with you about label flipping. We do not claim it as a technical contribution in this paper. As a matter of fact, label flipping has been used across several other settings. Following previous work, we simply use label flipping as an experimental tool to test the effect of label error on a model's disparity metric.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n>Their theoretical analysis seems to be more interesting. But is the chain rule analysis covered by other work? This is one part which I am not sure about regarding novelty.\\\\n\\\\nWe have updated the paper and the related work to more clearly delineate our contributions. As we note in the general comment, as far as we are aware, our collection of contributions towards understanding the effect of label error on a model's disparity metrics reveal new insights not previously present in the prior literature.\\\\n\\\\nOn the use of influence functions: influence functions have been previously used in the fairness setting as we discuss in the paper, but not in the specific way that we propose here. First, we are interested in the effect of a change in the label on a model's disparity metric. Others have considered how a change in the entire sample affects the model's prediction, or validation accuracy. Here, we are interested in the isolated effect of the label on a fairness property which has not been previously considered. Again, we reiterate that our collection of contributions goes beyond the proposed approach. \\\\n\\\\n**Label Noise vs Label Error**\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn this paper, label error refers to an error in the specific label of a single or a group of samples in a dataset. For example, a digit 1 in the MNIST dataset whose training label is indicated as a 8 exhibits label error. Specifically, we use the term to target classification tasks. More generally in the literature, label noise also captures regressions settings where the target variable is a scalar. Label noise subsumes label error as used in this paper. \\\\n\\\\nWe cited the \\\\\\\"Fair Classification with Group-Dependent Label Noise\\\\\\\" paper in our original version. The setting of the paper also maps to our definition of label error. More specifically, the paper considers an ERM problem subject to fairness constraints like equality of true positive rates where the training data has been corrupted with group (protected attribute) dependent noise. The paper provides theoretical results along with a scheme to obtain classifiers, in such settings, that are still robust to noise. Different from their setting, we consider unconstrained ERM (no fairness constraints during learning), and quantify the sensitivity of the resulting classifiers to both uniform and group-dependent noise. Even though we only consider classification tasks in this paper, the proposed approach can be applied to regression settings as well; however, we leave this for future work. We have updated the related work section with this discussion.\\\\n\\\\nThank you for the feedback, we hope we have adequately addressed your concerns. We will be happy to answer any additional questions. We encourage you to reconsider their score in light of our updates. \\\", \\\"overall_score\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"confidence\\\": null, \\\"technical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"empirical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"correctness\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"clarity_quality_novelty_reproducibility\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"recommendation\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"tldr\\\": \\\"\\\"}, {\\\"review_id\\\": \\\"hCyFNyixS_U\\\", \\\"paper_id\\\": \\\"RUzSobdYy0V\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\": null, \\\"paper_summary\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"strengths\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"weaknesses\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"comments\\\": \\\"We thank you for your comments and feedback. In addition to the general updates, we address your concerns here.\\\\n___\\\\n\\\\n**Comparison to noise-aware methods**\\\\n\\\\nAs we discussed in the general comment, we have now incorporated comparisons to noise-aware methods. \\\\n\\\\nAt a high level, for the majority group, we find that group calibration remain resilient to low rates of label error (below 25 percent). At highr rates (>30 percent label error), we start to see declines in these performance metrics. However, for the minority group (30 percent of the dataset), we observe that the disparity metrics show consistent sensitivity to label error. This finding suggests that noise-aware methods show disparate performance in their ability to confer robustness to label error depending on data group sizes. A similar observation has also been made for other algorithmic interventions like Pruning (Tran et. al. 2022, \\u201cPruning has disparate effect on model accuracy\\u201d & Hooker et. al. 2022 \\u201cWhat do deep neural networks forget\\u201d), Differential Privacy (Bagdasaryan et. al. 2018, \\u201cDifferential privacy has disparate impact on model accuracy\\u201d), and Selective Classification (Jones et. al. 2021, \\u201cSelective Classification Can Magnify Disparities Across Groups\\u201d) and adversarial training (Xu et. al. 2021 \\u201cTo be robust or to be fair: Towards fairness in adversarial training\\u201d).\\\\n\\\\n**Compare IF-Calib-Label to Noise-Aware Algorithms**\\\\n\\\\nThank you for the suggestion. We have performed the comparison that you request. First, we note that several noise-aware algorithms do not incorporate a module to **explicitly** identify noisy labels in the training data. The output of these algorithms is an already trained model that performs well on held-out data despite having been trained on data that has label error. In this work, we are interested in an approach that explicitly identifies problematic examples, so that they can either be sent to a human to relabel or automatically relabeled. Second, our goal is \\u00a0not to simply identify generic mislabeled examples, more specifically, we seek the particular mislabeled samples that have a high effect of the model's disparity metrics for a particular group. Most current noise aware algorithms are tailored to identifying mislabeled examples to improve validation/test set accuracy on the entire dataset. \\\\n\\\\nWe have now included two noise-aware algorithms (MEIDTM, CVPR\\u201922, and Confident Learning, Northcutt et. al. 2022, \\u201cConfident Learning: Estimating Uncertainty in Dataset Labels.\\u201d) in our baselines. In both cases, these approaches estimate a confidence/transition matrix on training samples to determine the probability of error of a sample's label for a given class. We compare against both approaches and find that they both underperform the influence-based approaches on the datasets considered. We updated the text (Appendix F) to discuss these results. \\\\n\\\\nAs we previously noted, we caution that such a comparison might not be fair for these algorithms since they were designed for identifying and correcting generic label error instead of those that disproportionately affect a model's disparity metric.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThank you for the feedback, we hope we have adequately addressed your concerns. We will be happy to answer any additional questions. We encourage them to reconsider their score in light of our updates. \\\\n\\\", \\\"overall_score\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"confidence\\\": null, \\\"technical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"empirical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"correctness\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"clarity_quality_novelty_reproducibility\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"recommendation\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"tldr\\\": \\\"\\\"}, {\\\"review_id\\\": \\\"GlXOIE-5Fxt\\\", \\\"paper_id\\\": \\\"RUzSobdYy0V\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\": null, \\\"paper_summary\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"strengths\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"weaknesses\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"comments\\\": \\\"\\\\n#### Comparison to noise-aware methods (Continued)\\\\n\\\\nThe aforementioned finding suggests that noise-aware methods show disparate performance in their ability to confer robustness to label error depending on data group sizes. A similar observation has also been made for other algorithmic interventions like Pruning (Tran et. al. 2022, \\u201cPruning has disparate effect on model accuracy\\u201d & Hooker et. al. 2022 \\u201cWhat do deep neural networks forget\\u201d), Differential Privacy (Bagdasaryan et. al. 2018, \\u201cDifferential privacy has disparate impact on model accuracy\\u201d), and Selective Classification (Jones et. al. 2021, \\u201cSelective Classification Can Magnify Disparities Across Groups\\u201d) and adversarial training (Xu et. al. 2021 \\u201cTo be robust or to be fair: Towards fairness in adversarial training\\u201d).\\\\n\\\\nTaken together, the results above suggest that our proposed identification and relabelling strategy addresses shortcomings of current noise-aware approaches. We plan to perform a more comprehensive empirical assessment for the final version of the paper.\\\\n\\\\n**Clarification of Experimental Setting**\\\\n1. **Majority Group and Minority Groups:** For each dataset, we have access to feature annotations that partition the dataset into groups. As indicated in Table 1, these annotations are group variables like Sex (Male, Female), and Race. For each group annotation, we can partition the training set into groups; the training subset with the largest size is the majority group, while the training subset with the smallest size is the minority group. We've updated the text to reflect this.\\\\n2. **Tabular Data:** To train CNNs on tabular data, we first apply a simple 2-layer MLP on the tabular dataset. We then simply extract representations from the hidden layer of the MLP, reshape these to be (32 by 32) two-dimensional and normalized ([0-1]). This strategy has been previously employed to train deep learning models on tabular data previously (Borisov et. al. 2022, \\u201cDeep Neural Networks and Tabular Data: A Survey\\u201d). We've updated the text to clarify this as well.\\\\n\\\\nThank you for the feedback, we hope we have adequately addressed your concerns. We will be happy to answer any additional questions.

In addition to the general updates, we address your concerns here.\\\\n___\\\\n\\\\n>The technical insight may not be enough. The authors have empirically illustrated that minority groups are more sensitive to label errors than majority groups. To make the conclusion more meaningful and practical, I think it would be great to add some theoretical analysis on the influence of label errors with different minority and majority group sizes.\\\\n\\\\nAs we discussed in the general comment, the three key contributions of this paper address challenges that were previously not understood in the label error literature. Specifically, the effects of label error (noise) on a model's average validation performance, empirically and theoretically, has been studied before. However, little was known, in the literature, about the effect of label error on a broad swath of model disparity metrics. In this paper, we address this challenge. In addition, we have now included a theoretical result that indicates that relabelling the problematic inputs that influence functions prioritizes reduces a model\\u2019s excess risk (under certain assumptions), and hence group calibration. \\\\n\\\\n>The proposed method for estimating the \\u2018influence\\u2019 of perturbing a training point\\u2019s label on a disparity metric may not practical.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent work, Schioppa et. al. (2022)(Scaling up influence functions) scale influence functions up to large transformer models with about 300 million parameters. To do this, they use Arnoldi iteration to approximate the hessian with a diagonalized matrix that can be easily inverted. Following their approach, we have now switched our implementation to theirs and can confirm that it scales to Resnet-50 models. This means that our approach can be easily applicable to large scale models. \\\\n\\\\n> ... needs a lot of retraining processes to detect the effect of all training inputs, which can be hard to apply to a dataset with high-dimensional features.\\\\n\\\\nOur proposed approach does not need retraining. As a matter of fact, the influence functions approach was originally developed to help side step the need to retrain models in order to estimate the effect of a training sample. As indicated in Equations 4 and 5 from the text, given an already trained model, we simply need to perform an implicit hessian vector product for each training point. One can iterate through all training points to perform such a product to estimate each point's influence.\\\\n\\\\n**Comparison to noise-aware methods**\\\\\\\\\\\\nThank you for sharing the references to these noise-aware methods. We have now incorporated these approaches into our settings. As we note in the contributions, we first identify problematic instances and then relabel these instances to improve the downstream model. \\\\n\\\\nThe goal and experimental setting of most noise-aware algorithms differ from our setup in two ways: 1) We are interested in group disparity, so we are focused on settings and datasets that includes a protected group attribute (often Race, Gender, and others in the fairness literature), and 2) We primarily seek to identify the problematic instances that need to be relabelled (often by a human labeler), and not automatically learn a model that is robust to label error. The output of our proposed approach is a set of points that should be relabelled by a human, whereas in noise-aware learning, the goal and output is a new model that is robust to label noise. Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 do not have protected attribute labels, so we did not originally experiment on these datasets.\\\\n\\\\nWe have now performed additional experiments using the modified Cifar-10 dataset from Hall et. al. (2022), \\\\\\\"A Systematic Study of Bias Amplification\\\\\\\". In this paper, the authors modify Cifar-10 to be a binary classification task, and then inject group labels into the two classes by inverting a fraction of the examples in each class. Given a specified parameter $\\\\\\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\in [0, 1/2]$, a $\\\\\\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\\\\\epsilon$ of the negative class is inverted, while a $\\\\\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\\\\\epsilon$ of the positive class is inverted leading to $2\\\\\\\\epsilon$ fraction of one group of samples and $1-2\\\\\\\\epsilon$ of the other group. In all experiments we set $\\\\\\\\epsilon=0.15$ for a 30 percent minority group membership.\\\\n\\\\nWe replicate our experimental setup on this task where we inject label noise into the training set. We test the MEIDTM, DivideMix, and a robust loss approach. We find consistent results across these approaches (New Figure 4 in text). At a high level, for the majority group, we find that model accuracy and downstream disparity metrics remain resilient to low rates of label error. At higher rates, we start to see declines in these performance metrics. However, for the minority group, the disparity metrics show consistent high sensitivity with increased label error. This finding suggests that noise-aware methods show disparate performance in their ability to confer robustness to label error depending on data group sizes. \\\\n\\\", \\\"overall_score\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"confidence\\\": null, \\\"technical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"empirical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"correctness\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"clarity_quality_novelty_reproducibility\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"recommendation\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"tldr\\\": \\\"\\\"}, {\\\"review_id\\\": \\\"n_ohPb-uodD\\\", \\\"paper_id\\\": \\\"RUzSobdYy0V\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\": null, \\\"paper_summary\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"strengths\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"weaknesses\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"comments\\\": \\\"We thank the reviewers for noting that we address an important problem (Xn1n, oCK7), with an interesting analysis (DK6U) that is very well organized, written, and easy to follow (DK6U, oCK7). First, we provide a high-level summary of the changes that we've made to the draft to address your feedback, and conclude with an overview of our key contributions, and how they differ from previous work.\\\\n___\\\\n\\\\nHere is the summary of updates that we've made to the draft: \\\\n\\\\n- Added a new section discussing empirical results on the sensitivity of models trained using noise-aware algorithms. The previous disparate effect that we observed for minority groups persists even for models trained with noise-aware algorithms (**Reviewers Xn1n and oCK7**).\\\\n- Revamped related work section to clarify our findings and differentiate our contributions from previous work. We have also incorporated all the references provided by the reviewers (**Reviewers Xn1n, oCK7, & DK6U**).\\\\n- Added empirical results on a new image and a text dataset and find that our results remain consistent across these datasets (**Reviewers DK6U**).\\\\n- Added new noise-aware baselines to label error identification experiments, and show that our proposed approach outperforms these approaches (**Reviewers Xn1n and oCK7**).\\\\n- Finally, we now provide a theoretical guarantee for the automatic fix proposed in the work. This theorem suggests that our proposed relabeling leads to models with provably improved group calibration (**Reviewers Xn1n and oCK7**).\\\\n\\\\nTo end this update, we discuss a common concern across all reviewers.\\\\n\\\\n**Novelty and Technical insight**\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe impact of label error on model accuracy is a well-studied problem. However, the effect of label error on a model's disparity metrics is still poorly understood in the literature. Performance metrics estimated on the entire validation (or test) set are typically invalid for more fine-grained groups in the dataset (See: Distributionally Robust Losses for Latent Covariate Mixtures, Duchi et. al. 2022). Consequently, we cannot expect results on the effect of label error on validation loss (or other performance metrics) to provide insights on how label error affects group calibration and other disparity metrics. Consequently, in this paper we characterize the impact of label error on these disparity metrics. \\\\n\\\\nTo contextualize the results in this paper, we now summarize our key contributions:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Empirical demonstration of sensitivity of a model's disparity metrics to label error:** First, we find that a model's group-based disparity metrics are sensitive to the presence of label error in either the training and/or test data. In particular, we find that such sensitivity is more pronounced for samples in the minority group in the data. We have now conducted additional experiments that also show that such sensitivity remains unaffected, for minority groups, even when models are trained with noise-aware algorithms. Consequently, our findings suggest that the presence of label error can render the results of a fairness audit unreliable. \\\\n2. **Approach to identify training inputs whose labels have high effect on any differentiable disparity metric:** Having established that a model's disparity metric is sensitive to label error, we then provide a way to identify the training samples whose wrong labels have the most influence on any differentiable disparity metric of interest. Our proposed formulation departs from previous approaches in a few ways. First, as we show in the results of Figure 4, simply prioritizing samples based on standard versions of training sample influence often identifies training samples in the majority class. Hence, the effect of label error on the minority group, the group most disproportionately affected, is often ignored with naive influence-based ranking. Second, we consider a more fine grained notion of influence where we characterize the impact of the change in label on the disparity metric of interest. Both of these specializations enable improved performance as the ablation on Figure 4 shows, and depart from the way influence functions were previously used in the literature.\\\\n3. **Correcting Label Error:** Lastly, in Section 5.2, we present an automatic relabel-and-finetune scheme that produces updated models with improved group calibration error. We compare this strategy to several others (now including noise-aware baselines), and find that our approach outperforms these other strategies. In addition, we now provide a theorem that demonstrates that the proposed strategy provably improves group calibration.\\\\n\\\\nTaken together, these contributions represent novel insights to the literature on the effect of label error on a model\\u2019s disparity metrics.\\\", \\\"overall_score\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"confidence\\\": null, \\\"technical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"empirical_novelty_and_significance\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"correctness\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"clarity_quality_novelty_reproducibility\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"recommendation\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"tldr\\\": \\\"\\\"}, {\\\"review_id\\\": \\\"7AWRUUgNqYe\\\", \\\"paper_id\\\": \\\"RUzSobdYy0V\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\": null, \\\"paper_summary\\\": \\\"For me, the motivation and research problems of this paper are strong and important.

Bobbie Chern Meta Inc.\\n\\n## ABSTRACT\\n\\nErrors in labels obtained via human annotation adversely affect a model's performance. Existing approaches propose ways to mitigate the effect of label error on a model's downstream accuracy, yet little is known about its impact on a model's disparity metrics[1](#page-0-0) . Here we study the effect of label error on a model's disparity metrics. We empirically characterize how varying levels of label error, in both training and test data, affect these disparity metrics. We find that group calibration and other metrics are sensitive to train-time and test-time label error\\u2014particularly for minority groups. This disparate effect persists even for models trained with noise-aware algorithms. To mitigate the impact of training-time label error, we present an approach to estimate the *influence* of a training input's label on a model's group disparity metric. We empirically assess the proposed approach on a variety of datasets and find significant improvement, compared to alternative approaches, in identifying training inputs that improve a model's disparity metric. We complement the approach with an automatic relabel-and-finetune scheme that produces updated models with, provably, improved group calibration error.\\n\\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\\n\\nLabel error (noise) \\u2014 mistakes associated with the label assigned to a data point \\u2014 is a pervasive problem in machine learning [\\\\(Northcutt et al.,](#page-11-0) [2021\\\\)](#page-11-0). For example, 30 percent of a random 1000 samples from the Google Emotions dataset [\\\\(Demszky et al.,](#page-10-0) [2020\\\\)](#page-10-0) had label errors [\\\\(Chen,](#page-9-0) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-0). Similarly, an analysis of the MS COCO dataset found that up to 37 percent (273,834 errors) of all annotations are erroneous [\\\\(Murdoch,](#page-11-1) [2022\\\\)](#page-11-1). Yet, little is known about the effect of label error on a model's group-based disparity metrics like equal odds [\\\\(Hardt et al.,](#page-10-1) [2016\\\\)](#page-10-1), group calibration [\\\\(Pleiss](#page-11-2) [et al.,](#page-11-2) [2017\\\\)](#page-11-2), and false positive rate [\\\\(Barocas et al.,](#page-9-1) [2019\\\\)](#page-9-1).\\n\\nIt is now common practice to conduct 'fairness' audits (see: [\\\\(Buolamwini and Gebru,](#page-9-2) [2018;](#page-9-2) [Raji and](#page-11-3) [Buolamwini,](#page-11-3) [2019;](#page-11-3) [Bakalar et al.,](#page-9-3) [2021\\\\)](#page-9-3)) of a model's predictions to identify data subgroups where the model underperforms. Label error in the test data used to conduct a fairness audit renders the results unreliable. Similarly, label error in the training data, especially if the error is systematically more prevalent in certain groups, can lead to models that associate erroneous labels to such groups. The reliability of a fairness audit rests on the assumption that labels are *accurate*; yet, the sensitivity of a model's disparity metrics to label error is still poorly understood. Towards such end, we ask:\\n\\n*what is the effect of label error on a model's disparity metric?*\\n\\nWe address the high-level question in a two-pronged manner via the following questions:\\n\\n- 1. Research Question 1: What is the sensitivity of a model's disparity metric to label errors in training and test data? Does the effect of label error vary based on group size?\\n- 2. Research Question 2: How can a practitioner identify training points whose labels have the most *influence* on a model's group disparity metric?\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-0-0\\\"></span><sup>1</sup>Group-based disparity metrics like subgroup calibration, false positive rate, false negative rate, equalized odds, and equal opportunity are more often known, colloquially, as *fairness metrics* in the literature. We use the term group-based disparity metrics in this work.\\n\\n#### CONTRIBUTIONS & SUMMARY OF FINDINGS\\n\\n![](imgs/RUzSobdYy0V__page_1_Picture_1.jpeg)\\n\\nFigure 1: A schematic of the test and train-time empirical sensitivity tests. Here we show the model training and fairness audit pipeline. Our proposed sensitivity tests capture the effect of label error, in both stages, on the disparity metric. In the Test-time sensitivity test, we flip the label of a portion of the test data and then compare the corresponding disparity metric (group calibration for example) for the flipped dataset to the metrics for a standard model where the test labels were not flipped. In the Train-time sensitivity test, we flip the labels of a portion of the training set, and then measure the change in disparity metric to a standard model.\\n\\nIn addressing these questions, we make two broad contributions:\\n\\n**Empirical Sensitivity Tests.** We assess the sensitivity of model disparity metrics to label errors with a label flipping experiment. First, we iteratively flip the labels of samples in the test set, for a fixed model, and then measure the corresponding change in the model disparity metric compared to an unflipped test set. Second, we fix the test set for the fairness audit but flip the labels of a proportion of the training samples. We then measure the change in the model disparity metrics for a model trained on the data with flipped labels. We perform these tests across a datasets and model combinations.\\n\\n**Training Point Influence on Disparity Metric.** We propose an approach, based on a modification to the influence of a training example on a test example's loss, to identify training points whose labels have undue effects on any disparity metric of interest on the test set. We empirically assess the proposed approach on a variety of datasets and find a 10-40% improvement, compared to alternative approaches that focus solely on model's loss, in identifying training inputs that improve a model's disparity metric.\\n\\n#### 2 Setup & Background\\n\\nIn this section, we discuss notation, and set the stage for our contributions by discussing the disparity metrics that we focus on. We also provide an overview of the datasets and models used in the experimental portions of the paper.<sup>2</sup>\\n\\nOverview of Notation. We consider prediction problems, i.e, settings where the task is to learn a mapping,  $\\\\theta: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y}$ , where  $\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d$  is the feature space,  $\\\\mathcal{Y} \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}$  is the output space, and  $\\\\mathcal{A}$  is a group identifier that partitions the population into disjoint sets e.g. race, gender. We can represent the tuple  $(x_i, a_i, y_i)$  as  $z_i$ . Consequently, the n training points can be written as:  $\\\\{z_i\\\\}_{i=1}^n$ . Throughout this work, we will only consider learning via empirical risk minimization (ERM), which corresponds to:  $\\\\hat{\\\\theta} := \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\ell(z_i, \\\\theta)$ . Similar to Koh and Liang (2017), we will assume that the ERM objective is twice-differentiable and strictly convex in the parameters. We focus on binary classification tasks, however, our analysis can be easily generalized.\\n\\n**Disparity Metrics.** We define a group disparity metric to be a function,  $\\\\mathcal{GD}$ , that gives a performance score given a model's probabilistic predictions ( $\\\\theta$  outputs the probability of belonging to the positive class) and 'ground-truth' labels. We consider the following metrics (We refer readers to the Appendix for a detailed overview of these metrics):\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-1-0\\\"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup>2</sup>We refer readers to the longer version of this work on the arxiv.

In this work, we measure calibration with two different metrics: 1) Expected Calibration Error (ECE) [\\\\(Naeini et al.,](#page-11-4) [2015;](#page-11-4) [Pleiss](#page-11-2) [et al.,](#page-11-2) [2017\\\\)](#page-11-2), and 2) the Brier Score [\\\\(Rufibach,](#page-11-5) [2010\\\\)](#page-11-5) (BS).\\n- 2. (*Generalized*) False Positive Rate (FPR): is GDfpr(\\u03b8) = E[\\u03b8(xi) | y<sup>i</sup> = 0] (see [Guo et al.](#page-10-4) [\\\\(2017\\\\)](#page-10-4)),\\n- 3.

Error Rate (ER): is the GDer(\\u03b8) = 1 \\u2212 acc(\\u03b8).\\n\\nWe consider these metrics separately for each group as opposed to relative differences. For each dataset, we consider the protected data subgroup with the largest size as the majority group, and the group the smallest size is the minority group.\\n\\nDatasets. We consider datasets across different modalities: 4 tabular, and a text dataset. A description of these datasets along with test accuracy is provided in Table 2. Each dataset contains annotations with a group label for both training and test data, so we are able to manipulate these labels for our empirical sensitivity tests. For the purposes of this work, we assume that the provided labels are the ground-truth\\u2014a strong assumption that nevertheless does not impact the interpretation of our findings.\\n\\nModel. We consider three kinds of model classes in this work: 1) a logistic regression model, 2) a Gradient-boosted Tree (GBT) classifier for the tabular datasets, and 3) a ResNet-18 model. We only consider the logistic regression and GBT models for tabular data, while we fine-tune a ResNet-18 model on embeddings for the text data.\\n\\n## 3 EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT OF LABEL SENSITIVITY\\n\\nIn this section, we perform empirical sensitivity tests to quantify the impact of label error on test group disparity metrics. We conduct tests on data from two different stages of the ML pipeline: 1) Test-time (test dataset) and 2) Training-time (training data). We use as our primary experimental tool: label flipping, i.e., we flip the labels of a percentage of the samples, uniformly at random in either the test or training set, and then measure the concomitant change in the model disparity metric. We assume that each dataset's labels are the ground truth and that flipping the label results in label error for the samples whose labels have been overturned. Recent literature has termed this setting synthetic noise, i.e., the label flipping simulates noise that might not be representative of real-world noise in labels [\\\\(Arpit et al.,](#page-9-5) [2017;](#page-9-5) [Zhang et al.,](#page-12-0) [2021;](#page-12-0) [Jiang et al.,](#page-10-5) [2020\\\\)](#page-10-5).\\n\\n## 3.1 SENSITIVITY TO TEST-TIME LABEL ERROR\\n\\nOverview & Experimental Setup. The goal of the test-time empirical test is to measure the impact of label error on the group calibration error of a fixed model. Consider the setting where a model has been trained, and a fairness assessment is to be conducted on the model. What impact does label error, in the test set used to conduct the audit, have on the calibration error on the test data? The test-time empirical tests answer this question. Given a fixed model, we iteratively flip a percentage of the labels, uniformly at random, ranging from zero to 30 percent in the test data. We then estimate the model's calibration using the modified dataset. Critically, we keep the model fixed while performing these tests across each dataset.\\n\\nResults. In Figure [2,](#page-3-0) we report results of the label flipping experiments across 6 tasks. On the horizontal axis, we have the percentage of labels flipped in the test dataset, while on the vertical\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-3-0\\\"></span>![](imgs/RUzSobdYy0V__page_3_Figure_0.jpeg)\\n\\nFigure 2: Test-time Label Flipping Results across. For each dataset, we plot the percent change in calibration error versus the corresponding percentage change in label error. Here, we plot the minority (smallest) group as well as the majority (largest) group. These two groups represent two ends of the spectrum for the impact of label error. We observe that across all datasets, the minority group incurs higher percentage change in group calibration compared to the majority group.\\n\\naxis, we have the percentage change in the model's calibration. For each dataset, we compute model calibration for two demographic groups in the dataset, the majority and the minority\\u2014in size\\u2013groups. We do this since these two groups constitute the two ends of the spectrum in the dataset. As shown, we observe a more distinctive effect for the minority group across all datasets. This is to be expected since flipping even a small number samples in the minority group can have a dramatic effect on test and training accuracy within this group. For both groups, we observe a changes to the calibration error. For example, for the Income prediction task on the Adult dataset, a 10 percent label error induces at least a 20 percent change in the model's test calibration error. These results suggest that test-time label error has more pronounced effects for minority groups. Similarly, we observe for other disparity metrics (See Appendix) across all model classes that increases in percentage of labels flipped disproportionately affects the minority group.\\n\\n## 3.2 SENSITIVITY TO TRAINING LABEL ERROR\\n\\nOverview & Experimental Setup. The goal of the training-time empirical tests is to measure the impact of label error on a trained model. More specifically, given a training set in which a fraction of the samples' labels have been flipped, what effect does the label error have on the calibration error compared to a model trained on data without label error? We simulate this setting by creating multiple copies of each of the datasets where a percentage of the training labels have been flipped uniformly at random. We then assess the model calibration of these different model using the same fixed test dataset. Under similar experimental training conditions for these models, we are then able to quantify the effect of training label error on a model's test calibration error. We conduct this analysis across all dataset-model task pairs.\\n\\nResults & Implications. We show the results of the training-time experiments in Figure [3.](#page-4-0) Similar to the test-time experiments, we find minority groups are more sensitive to label error than larger groups. Specifically, we find that even a 5 percent label error can induce significant changes in the disparity metrics, of a model trained on such data, for these groups.\\n\\nA conjecture for the higher sensitivity to extreme training-time error is that a model trained on significant label error might have a more difficult time learning patterns in the minority class where there are not enough samples to begin with. Consequently, the generalization performance of this model worsens for inputs that belong to the minority group. Alternatively, in the majority group, the proportion of corrupted labels due to label error is smaller. This might mean that uniform flipping does not affect the proportion of true labels compared to the minority group. Even though the majority group exhibits label error, there still exists enough samples with true labels such that a model can learn the underlying signal for the majority class.\\n\\n![](imgs/RUzSobdYy0V__page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)\\n\\nFigure 3: **Training-time Label Flipping Results**. For each dataset, we plot the percent change in calibration error versus the corresponding percentage change in label error for the training set. Here, we plot the minority (smallest) group as well as the majority (largest) groups by size. Similar to the test-time setting, we observe that across all datasets, the minority group incurs higher percentage change in group calibration compared to the majority group. However, we observe a larger magnitude change for the minority groups.\\n\\nA second important finding is that overparameterization seems to confer more resilience to training label error. We find that for the same levels of training label error, an overparametrized model is less sensitive to such change compared to a model with a smaller number of parameters. Recent work suggests that models that learn functions that are more aligned with the underlying target function of the data generation process are more resilient to training label error (Li et al., 2021). It might be that compared to linear and tree-based models, an overparametrized deep net is more capable of learning an aligned function.\\n\\n### 3.3 Noise-Aware Robust Learning has Disparate Impact\\n\\nOverview & Experimental Setup. We now assess whether training models with noise-aware algorithmic interventions (e.g. robust loss functions (Ma et al., 2020; Ghosh et al., 2017)) results in models whose disparity metrics have reduced sensitivity to label error in the training set. We test this hypothesis on a modified Cifar-10 dataset following the setting of Hall et al. (2022). Specifically, the Cifar-10 dataset is modified to a binary classification setting along with group labels by inverting a subset of each class's examples. Given a specified parameter  $\\\\epsilon \\\\in [0, 1/2]$ , a  $\\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\epsilon$  of the negative class is inverted, while a  $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\epsilon$  of the positive class is inverted leading to  $2\\\\epsilon$  fraction of one group of samples and  $1 - 2\\\\epsilon$  of the other group. In all experiments we set  $\\\\epsilon = 0.15$  for a 30 percent minority group membership. We replicate the label flipping experiment on the task\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-4-0\\\"></span>![](imgs/RUzSobdYy0V__page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)\\n\\nFigure 4: Effect of Noise-aware algorithms on group calibration.\\n\\nwith a Resnet-18 model. We test the MEIDTM (Cheng et al., 2022), DivideMix (Li et al., 2020), and a robust loss approach (Ghosh et al., 2017).\\n\\n**Results.** At a high level, for the majority group, we find that group calibration remains resilient to low rates of label error (below 25 percent). At high rates (>30 percent label error), we start to see increased sensitivity. However, for the minority group (30 percent of the dataset), we observe group calibration remains sensitive to label error even at low levels. This finding suggests that noise-aware methods show are more effective for larger groups in the data. A similar observation has also been made for other algorithmic interventions like Pruning (Tran et al., 2022; Hooker et al., 2019), differential privacy (Bagdasaryan et al., 2019), selective classification (Jones et al., 2020) and adversarial training (Xu et al., 2021).\\n\\n#### 4 INFLUENCE OF TRAINING LABEL ON TEST DISPARITY METRIC\\n\\nWe now present an approach for estimating the 'influence' of perturbing a training point's label on a disparity metric of interest. We consider: 1) up-weighting a training point, and 2) perturbing the training label.\\n\\n**Upweighting a training point.** Let  $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z_i}$  be the ERM solution when a model is trained on all data points,  $\\\\{z_j\\\\}_{j=1}^n$ , except  $z_i$ . The influence,  $\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}}$ , of datapoint,  $z_i$ , on the model parameters is then defined:  $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z_i} - \\\\hat{\\\\theta}$ . This measure indicates how much the parameters change when the model is 'refit' on all training data points except  $z_i$ . Koh and Liang (2017) give a closed-form estimate of this quantity as:\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-5-0\\\"></span>\\n$$\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}} \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\frac{d\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon, z_i}}{d\\\\epsilon} \\\\bigg|_{\\\\epsilon=0} = -H_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}^{-1} \\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\ell(z_i, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}), \\\\tag{1}$$\\n\\nwhere H is the hessian, i.e.,  $H_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\nabla_{\\\\theta}^{2} \\\\ell(z_{i}, \\\\theta)$ .\\n\\nThe loss on a test example,  $\\\\ell(z_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})$ , is a function of the model parameters, so using the chain-rule, we can estimate the influence,  $\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,loss}}(z_i, z_t)$ , of a training point,  $z_i$ , on  $\\\\ell(z_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})$  as:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,loss}}(z_i, z_t) \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\frac{d\\\\ell(z_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon, z_i})}{d\\\\epsilon} \\\\bigg|_{\\\\epsilon = 0} = -\\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\ell(z_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^{\\\\top} H_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}^{-1} \\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\ell(z_i, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}). \\\\tag{2}$$\\n\\n**Perturbing a training point's label.** A second notion of influence that Koh and Liang (2017) study is how perturbing a training point leads to changes in the model parameters. Specifically, given a training input,  $z_i$ , that is a tuple  $(x_i, y_i)$ , how would the perturbation,  $z_i \\\\to z_{i,\\\\delta}$ , which is defined as  $(x_i, y_i) \\\\to (x_i, y_i + \\\\delta)$ , change the model's predictions? Koh and Liang (2017) give a closed-form estimate of this quantity as:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{pert,loss,y}}(z_j, z_t) \\\\approx -\\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\ell(z_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{z_j, \\\\delta, -z_j})^{\\\\top} H_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}^{-1} \\\\nabla_y \\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\ell(z_j, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}). \\\\tag{3}$$\\n\\nAdapting influence functions to group disparity metrics. We now propose modifications that allow us to compute the influence of a training point on a test group disparity metric (See Appendix D for longer discussion). Let  $S_t$  be a set of test examples. We can then denote  $\\\\mathcal{GD}(S_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})$  as the group disparity metric of interest, e.g., the estimated ECE for the set  $S_t$  given parameter setting  $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$ .\\n\\nInfluence of upweighting a training point on a test group disparity metric. A group disparity metric on the test set is a function of the model parameters; consequently, we can apply the chain rule to  $\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\mathrm{up,params}}$  (from Equation 1) to estimate the influence,  $\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\mathrm{up,disparity}}$ , of up-weighting a training point on the disparity metric as follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,disparity}}(z_i, S_t) \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\frac{d\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\mathcal{D}(S_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon, z_i})}{d\\\\epsilon} \\\\bigg|_{\\\\epsilon=0} = -\\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\mathcal{G}\\\\mathcal{D}(S_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^{\\\\top} \\\\frac{d\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon, z_i}}{d\\\\epsilon} \\\\bigg|_{\\\\epsilon=0}, \\n= -\\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\mathcal{G}\\\\mathcal{D}(S_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^{\\\\top} H_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}^{-1} \\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\ell(z_i, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}).$$\\n(4)\\n\\nWe now have a closed-form expression for a training point's influence on a test group disparity metric.\\n\\n**Influence of perturbing a training point's label on a test group disparity metric.** We now consider the influence of a training label perturbation on a group disparity metric of interest. To do this, we simply consider the group disparity metric function as the quantity of interest instead of the test loss. Consequently, the closed-form expression for the influence of a modification to the training label on disparity for a given test set is:\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-5-2\\\"></span><span id=\\\"page-5-1\\\"></span>\\n$$\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{pert,disparity,y}}(z_j, S_t) \\\\approx -\\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\mathcal{D}(S_t, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^{\\\\top} H_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}}^{-1} \\\\nabla_y \\\\nabla_{\\\\theta} \\\\ell(z_j, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}). \\\\tag{5}$$\\n\\nWith Equations 4 and 5, we have the key quantities of interest that allows us to rank training points, in terms of influence, on the test group disparity metric.\\n\\n## 5 IDENTIFYING AND CORRECTING TRAINING LABEL ERROR\\n\\nIn this section, we empirically assess the modified influence expressions for calibration across these datasets for prioritizing mislabelled samples. We find that the prioritization scheme shows improvement, compared to alternative approaches. In addition, we propose an approach to automatically correct the labels identified by our proposed approach.\\n\\n#### 5.1 IDENTIFYING LABEL ERROR\\n\\nOverview & Experimental Question. We are interested in surfacing training points whose change in label will induce a concomitant change in a test disparity metric like group calibration. Specifically, we ask: When the training points are ranked by influence on test calibration, are the most highly influential training points most likely to have the wrong labels? We conduct our experiments to directly measure a method's ability to answer this question.\\n\\nExperimental Setup. For each dataset, we randomly flip the labels of 10 \\u2212 30 percent of the training samples. We then train on this modified dataset. In this task, we have direct access to the ground-truth of the exact samples whose labels were flipped. This allows us to directly compare the performance of our proposed methods to each of the baselines on this task. We then rank training points using a number of baseline approaches as well as the modified influence approaches. For the top 50 examples, we consider what fraction of these examples had flipped labels in the training set. We discuss additional experimental details in the Appendix.\\n\\nApproaches & Baselines. We consider the following methods: 1) IF-Calib: The closed-form approximation to the influence of a training point on the test calibration; 2) IF-Calib-Label: The closed-form approximation to the influence of a training point's label on the test calibration; 3) Loss: A baseline method which is the training loss evaluated at each data point in the training set. The intuition is that, presumably, more difficult training samples will have higher training loss. We also consider several additional baselines that we discuss in the Appendix.\\n\\n![](imgs/RUzSobdYy0V__page_6_Figure_6.jpeg)\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-6-0\\\"></span>Figure 5: Empirical Results for Training Point Ranking Across 6 datasets. For the top 50 most influential examples, we show the proportion of samples whose labels were flipped in the training data.\\n\\nResults: Prioritizing Samples. In Figure [5,](#page-6-0) we show the performance of the two approximations that we consider in this work as well as two baselines. We plot the fraction of inputs, out of the top ranked 50 ranked training points, whose labels were flipped in the training set. The higher this proportion, then the more effective an approach is in identifying the samples that likely have wrong labels. In practice, the goal is to surface these training samples and have a domain expert inspect them. If a larger proportion of the items to be inspected are mislabeled, then a higher proportion of training set mistakes, i.e. label error, can be fixed. Across the different datasets, we find a 10-40 percent improvement, compared to baseline approaches, in identifying critical training data points whose labels need to be reexamined.\\n\\nWe find the loss baseline to be ineffective for ranking in our experiments. A possible reason is that modern machine learning models can typically be trained to 'memorize' the training data; resulting in settings where a model has low loss even on outliers or mislabeled examples. In such a case, ranking by training loss for a sample is an ineffective ranking strategy. We find that the noise-aware approaches perform similarly to the IF-Norm baseline. We defer the results of the uncertainty-based baselines and the noise-aware methods to Appendix (Section F). We find that these baselines also underperform our proposed approaches.\\n\\n#### 5.2 Correcting Label Error\\n\\nWe take label error identification one step further to automatically relabelling inputs that have identified as critical. We restrict our focus to binary classification where the label set is  $\\\\{0,1\\\\}$ , and the corresponding relabelling function is simply  $1-y_i$ , where  $y_i$  is the predicted label.\\n\\n**Setup & Experiment**: We consider the logistic regression model across all tasks for a setting with 20 percent training label error. We consider calibration as the disparity function of interest. We then rank the top 20 percent of training points by label-disparity influence, our proposed approach. For these points, we apply the relabelling function, and then fine-tune the model for an additional epoch with the modified labels.\\n\\n**Results:** First, we observe an improvement, in group calibration, across all groups, with larger improvement coming from the smallest group. As expected, we also observe a decrease in the average loss for the overall training set. These results point to increasing promise of automatic relabeling.\\n\\n**Theoretical Justification.** We now present a theorem that suggests that the influence priorization and relabeling scheme described above provably leads to better calibrated models.\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-7-0\\\"></span>**Theorem 1.** Given a  $\\\\kappa$ -strongly convex loss function  $\\\\ell(.,.)$ , with  $\\\\kappa>0$ , a training dataset,  $\\\\mathcal{D}$ , where A indexes the data groups, and a model,  $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}: x_i \\\\to y_i$ , optimized via  $\\\\ell(.,.)$  that maps inputs to labels. Let  $\\\\mathcal{Q}$  be a set of test examples all belonging to group A=a, where  $\\\\mathrm{ECal}_{\\\\mathcal{Q}}(\\\\hat{\\\\theta})$  is the expected calibration error of  $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$  on the set  $\\\\mathcal{Q}$ . In addition, let  $\\\\mathcal{D}_{A=a}$  be the set of problematic training examples, belonging to group a, prioritized based on influence, i.e.,  $\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\mathrm{pert,calib},y^i}(x_a^i,\\\\mathcal{Q})>0$ . We term a model trained on a different training set  $(\\\\mathcal{D}_+)$  where the problematic examples have been relabeled to be  $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_R$ . Analogously, the expected calibration error of this new model on the set  $\\\\mathcal{Q}$  is  $\\\\mathrm{ECal}_{\\\\mathcal{Q}}(\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_R)$ . We have that:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{ECal}_{\\\\mathcal{Q}}(\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_R) \\\\leq \\\\mathrm{ECal}_{\\\\mathcal{Q}}(\\\\hat{\\\\theta}).$$\\n\\nWe defer the proof to the Appendix. Theorem 1 suggests that when a model is trained on a relabeled dataset, following the influence prioritization scheme, the expected group calibration of the retrained model should be lower than that of a model trained on a dataset that has not been relabeled.\\n\\n#### 6 RELATED WORK\\n\\nWe discuss directly related work here, and defer a longer discussion to Section A of the Appendix.\\n\\nImpact of Label Error/Noise on Model Accuracy. Learning under label error falls under the category more commonly known as *learning under noise* (Fr\\u00e9nay and Verleysen, 2013; Natarajan et al., 2013; Bootkrajang and Kab\\u00e1n, 2012). *Noise* in learning can come from different either input features or the labels. In this work, we focus on label error\\u2014categorization mistakes associated with the label in both the test and training data. Previous work focused primarily on the effect of label error in the training data; however, we advance this line of work to investigate the effect of label error in the test data used to conduct a fairness audit on the reliability of the audit. Model resilience to training label error has been studied for both synthetic (Arpit et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021; Rolnick et al., 2017) and real-world noise settings (Jiang et al., 2020). A major line of inquiry is the development of algorithmic approaches to learn accurate models given a training set with noisy labels. These approaches include model regularization (Srivastava et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017), bootstrap (Reed et al., 2014), knowledge distillation (Jiang et al., 2020), instance weighting (Ren et al., 2018; Jiang and Nachum, 2020), robust loss functions (Ma et al., 2020; Ghosh et al., 2017), or trusted data (Hendrycks et al., 2018), joint training (Wei et al., 2020), mixture models in semi-supervised learning (Li et al.,\\n\\n[2020\\\\)](#page-11-8), and methods to learn a transition matrix that captures noise dependencies [\\\\(Cheng et al.,](#page-9-6) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-6). In contrast to this line of work, we primarily seek to identify the problematic instances that need to be relabelled, often by a human labeler, and not automatically learn a model that is robust to label error.\\n\\nImpact of Label Error on Model *'Fairness'*. This work contributes to the burgeoning area that studies the impact of label error on a model's 'fairness' (termed 'group-based disparity' in this paper) metrics. [Fogliato et al.](#page-10-13) [\\\\(2020\\\\)](#page-10-13) studied a setting in which the labels used for model training are a noisy proxy for the true label of interest, e.g., predicting rearrest as a proxy for rearrest. [Wang et al.](#page-12-6) [\\\\(2021\\\\)](#page-12-6) considers an ERM problem subject to group disparity constraints with group-dependent label noise, and provides theoretical results along with a scheme to obtain classifiers that are robust to noise. Different from their setting, we consider unconstrained ERM (no fairness constraints during learning). Similarly, [Konstantinov and Lampert](#page-10-14) [\\\\(2021\\\\)](#page-10-14) study the effect of adversarial data corruptions on fair learning in a PAC model. [Jiang and Nachum](#page-10-11) [\\\\(2020\\\\)](#page-10-11) propose a re-weighting scheme that is able to correct for label noise.\\n\\nInfluence Functions & Their Uses. Influence functions originate from robust statistics where it is used as a tool to identify outliers [\\\\(Cook and Weisberg,](#page-9-9) [1982;](#page-9-9) [Cook,](#page-9-10) [1986;](#page-9-10) [Hampel,](#page-10-15) [1974\\\\)](#page-10-15). [Koh and](#page-10-2) [Liang](#page-10-2) [\\\\(2017\\\\)](#page-10-2) introduced influence functions for modern machine learning models, and used them for various model debugging tasks. Most similar to our work, [Sattigeri et al.](#page-12-7) [\\\\(2022\\\\)](#page-12-7) and [Li and Liu](#page-11-13) [\\\\(2022\\\\)](#page-11-13) also consider the influence of a training point on model's disparity metric, and present intriguing results that demonstrate that reweighting training samples can improve a model's disparity metrics. Here, we focus specifically on the role of mislabeled examples; however, our goal aligns with theirs. Similarly, [Kong et al.](#page-10-16) [\\\\(2021\\\\)](#page-10-16) propose RDIA, a relabelling scheme based on the influence function that is able to provably correct for label error in the training data. RDIA identifies training samples that have a high influence on the test loss for a validation set; however, we focus on identifying training samples that influence a group-disparity metric on a test/audit set. We also rely on their technical results to prove Theorem [1.](#page-7-0)\\n\\nIn recent work, [De-Arteaga et al.](#page-9-11) [\\\\(2021\\\\)](#page-9-11) study expert consistency in data labeling and use influence functions to estimate the impact of labelers on a model's predictions. Along similar direction, [Brunet](#page-9-12) [et al.](#page-9-12) [\\\\(2019\\\\)](#page-9-12) adapt the influence function approach to measure how removing a small part of a training corpus, in a word embedding task, affects test bias as measured by the word embedding association test [Caliskan et al.](#page-9-13) [\\\\(2017\\\\)](#page-9-13). [Feldman and Zhang](#page-10-17) [\\\\(2020\\\\)](#page-10-17) use influence functions to estimate how likely a training point is to have been memorized by a model. More generally, influence functions are gaining widespread use as a tool for debugging model predictions [\\\\(Barshan et al.,](#page-9-14) [2020;](#page-9-14) [Han et al.,](#page-10-18) [2020;](#page-10-18) [Yeh et al.,](#page-12-8) [2018;](#page-12-8) [Pruthi et al.,](#page-11-14) [2020\\\\)](#page-11-14). Different from these uses of influence functions, here we isolate the effect of a training point's label on a model's disparity metric on a audit data.\\n\\n## 7 CONCLUSION\\n\\nIn this paper, we sought to address two key questions: *1) What is the impact of label error on a model's group disparity metric, especially for smaller groups in the data;* and *2) How can a practitioner identify training samples whose labels would also lead to a significant change in the test disparity metric of interest?* We find that disparity metrics are, indeed, sensitive to test and training time label error particularly for minority groups in the data. In addition, we present an approach for estimating the 'influence' of perturbing a training point's label on a disparity metric of interest, and find a 10-40% improvement, compared to alternative approaches, in identifying training inputs that improve a model's disparity metric. We present an approach to estimate the effect of a training input's label on a model's group disparity metric. Lastly, perform a simple automatic relabel-and-finetune scheme that produces updated models with, provably, improved group calibration error.\\n\\nOur findings come with certain limitations. In this work, we focused on the influence of label error on disparity metrics. However, other components of the ML pipeline can also impact downstream model performance. The proposed empirical tests simulate the impact of label error; however, it might be the case that real-world label error is less pernicious to model learning dynamics than the synthetic flipping results suggest. Ultimately, we see our work as helping to provide insight and as an additional tool for practitioners seeking to address the challenge of label error particularly in relation to a disparity metric of interest.\\n\\n## REFERENCES\\n\\n- <span id=\\\"page-9-5\\\"></span>Devansh Arpit, Stanis\\u0142aw Jastrz\\u02dbebski, Nicolas Ballas, David Krueger, Emmanuel Bengio, Maxinder S Kanwal, Tegan Maharaj, Asja Fischer, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio, et al.

The authors found that empirically, label errors have a larger influence on minority groups than on majority groups. The authors proposed a method to estimate the influence of changing a single training input\\u2019s label on a model\\u2019s group disparity metric. Reviewers agree that the studied problem is important and may have many practical implications and that the proposed method is well-motivated. At the same time, reviewers also have several sensible concerns; e.g., the technical contribution may not be strong enough, and the proposed method may not practical to deal with real-world machine learning datasets.

      "    \"comments\": \"Thank you for your feedback, and challenging us to more clearly delineate our technical contributions. We provide additional clarification here.\\n\\n___\\n\\n\\n**Difference from the Koh et. al. (Understanding black-box predictions via influence functions)**\\n>The technical results in this paper seem highly dependent on the previous paper \\\"Understanding black-box predictions via influence functions\\\". Specifically, From Eq (1) to Eq. (3), all the results are proposed by the previous paper.\\n\\n**Answer**: The reviewer is correct that Eqns 1-3 are due to Koh et. al. We do not claim these as contributions; we provide these to aid the reader. Our key contributions in that section are Eqns 4-5. We now provide additional clarification.\\n\\nIn using influence functions, our goal is to: 1) identify training samples whose *label have a high influence on any disparity metric of interest (e.g. group calibration, false positive rate, false negative rate, etc.)*, and 2) propose a method to improve these disparity metrics via relabeling. \\n\\nIn Koh et. al., they propose the influence functions to rank training samples that have a high influence on 1) the parameters, and 2) a single test example's loss or prediction. We extend these results to fairness metrics. To reinforce our point that such an extension is needed, the results of Fig. 5 demonstrate that a direct application of the original influence functions approach does not capture group-based effects that is often key for improving fairness metrics.\\n\\nEqns 4 and 5 directly address these challenges, and allow us to repurpose influence functions for addressing *fairness* challenges. Our presentation in Section 4 is sparse, due to space constraints.  However, we will add a paragraph to more clearly discuss these key differences. We will also expand the derivation in the Appendix to more clearly show these differences as well. \\n\\n\\n**A note about the relabel-and-finetune scheme**\\\\\\nWe saw a previous comment about the relabeling portion of the paper. To clarify, we have now compared to schemes like DivideMix and MEIDTM. We discuss these results in Sections 3.3 (Noise-aware robust learning has disparate impact) and 5.1(Identifying label error) in the updated draft. \\n\\nA point of caution first, since our setting requires sensitive group variables, we cannot directly use Cifar-10 and Cifar-100. We modify Cifar-10, as we discussed in the part 1 of the previous comment, to inject group annotations. In these experiments we make two important findings: \\n\\n1. Previous relabeling methods provide improvements for the majority group in the data, but not the minority group;\\n2. Our proposed group-based relabelling scheme outperforms these approaches since it directly identifies minority samples whose label have a high effect on that group's disparity metric. \\n\\nThese two findings demonstrate that our proposed scheme provides benefits that current approaches donot address.\\n\\n**Theorem 1 is trivial**\\\\\\nWe respectfully disagree with this opinion; the insight of theorem is obvious---in hindsight. However, we agree with the reviewer that the theorem's takeaway that if one relabels mislabeled examples, on a group basis, it leads to an improvement in group calibration is not surprising.\\n\\nIn a previous result, Kong et al. show that if one relabels by influence, the *average* validation loss, across all samples, of the fine-tuned model is reduced. However, as we discussed earlier, prioritization by generic influence favors the majority group, so it is not obvious that relabeling should improve **group calibration**, even for the minority group. In addition, the relationship between group calibration and the average validation loss is unclear. The key insight here is a way to relate a per-group average loss to that group's calibration. We are currently unaware of any previous result that demonstrates this point. Even though the theorem's result is not surprising, it does provide justification for the scheme we proposed. \\n\\nWe thank the reviewer again for the feedback, and we will be happy to answer any additional questions that you have.\",\n",

      "    \"comments\": \"We thank you for your comments and feedback. In addition to the general updates, we address your concerns here.\\n___\\n\\n**Reliability of Empirical Conclusions**\\\\\\nAs we note in the general comment, our results and findings hold even as we expand to several other datasets. The consistency of the results across these datasets suggests that our conclusion is not dataset dependent. We have now added additional datasets and suggestive theoretical insights that indicate that our findings are not an artifact due to a specific experimental or dataset setting. \\n\\n**Label Flipping:** We agree with you about label flipping. We do not claim it as a technical contribution in this paper. As a matter of fact, label flipping has been used across several other settings. Following previous work, we simply use label flipping as an experimental tool to test the effect of label error on a model's disparity metric.\\n\\n\\n>Their theoretical analysis seems to be more interesting. But is the chain rule analysis covered by other work? This is one part which I am not sure about regarding novelty.\\n\\nWe have updated the paper and the related work to more clearly delineate our contributions. As we note in the general comment, as far as we are aware, our collection of contributions towards understanding the effect of label error on a model's disparity metrics reveal new insights not previously present in the prior literature.\\n\\nOn the use of influence functions: influence functions have been previously used in the fairness setting as we discuss in the paper, but not in the specific way that we propose here. First, we are interested in the effect of a change in the label on a model's disparity metric. Others have considered how a change in the entire sample affects the model's prediction, or validation accuracy. Here, we are interested in the isolated effect of the label on a fairness property which has not been previously considered. Again, we reiterate that our collection of contributions goes beyond the proposed approach. \\n\\n**Label Noise vs Label Error**\\\\\\nIn this paper, label error refers to an error in the specific label of a single or a group of samples in a dataset. For example, a digit 1 in the MNIST dataset whose training label is indicated as a 8 exhibits label error. Specifically, we use the term to target classification tasks. More generally in the literature, label noise also captures regressions settings where the target variable is a scalar. Label noise subsumes label error as used in this paper. \\n\\nWe cited the \\\"Fair Classification with Group-Dependent Label Noise\\\" paper in our original version. The setting of the paper also maps to our definition of label error. More specifically, the paper considers an ERM problem subject to fairness constraints like equality of true positive rates where the training data has been corrupted with group (protected attribute) dependent noise. The paper provides theoretical results along with a scheme to obtain classifiers, in such settings, that are still robust to noise. Different from their setting, we consider unconstrained ERM (no fairness constraints during learning), and quantify the sensitivity of the resulting classifiers to both uniform and group-dependent noise. Even though we only consider classification tasks in this paper, the proposed approach can be applied to regression settings as well; however, we leave this for future work. We have updated the related work section with this discussion.\\n\\nThank you for the feedback, we hope we have adequately addressed your concerns. We will be happy to answer any additional questions. We encourage you to reconsider their score in light of our updates. \",\n",

In addition to the general updates, we address your concerns here.\\n___\\n\\n**Comparison to noise-aware methods**\\n\\nAs we discussed in the general comment, we have now incorporated comparisons to noise-aware methods. \\n\\nAt a high level, for the majority group, we find that group calibration remain resilient to low rates of label error (below 25 percent). At highr rates (>30 percent label error), we start to see declines in these performance metrics. However, for the minority group (30 percent of the dataset), we observe that the disparity metrics show consistent sensitivity to label error. This finding suggests that noise-aware methods show disparate performance in their ability to confer robustness to label error depending on data group sizes. A similar observation has also been made for other algorithmic interventions like Pruning (Tran et. al. 2022, \\u201cPruning has disparate effect on model accuracy\\u201d & Hooker et. al. 2022 \\u201cWhat do deep neural networks forget\\u201d), Differential Privacy (Bagdasaryan et. al. 2018, \\u201cDifferential privacy has disparate impact on model accuracy\\u201d), and Selective Classification (Jones et. al. 2021, \\u201cSelective Classification Can Magnify Disparities Across Groups\\u201d) and adversarial training (Xu et. al. 2021 \\u201cTo be robust or to be fair: Towards fairness in adversarial training\\u201d).\\n\\n**Compare IF-Calib-Label to Noise-Aware Algorithms**\\n\\nThank you for the suggestion. We have performed the comparison that you request. First, we note that several noise-aware algorithms do not incorporate a module to **explicitly** identify noisy labels in the training data. The output of these algorithms is an already trained model that performs well on held-out data despite having been trained on data that has label error. In this work, we are interested in an approach that explicitly identifies problematic examples, so that they can either be sent to a human to relabel or automatically relabeled. Second, our goal is \\u00a0not to simply identify generic mislabeled examples, more specifically, we seek the particular mislabeled samples that have a high effect of the model's disparity metrics for a particular group. Most current noise aware algorithms are tailored to identifying mislabeled examples to improve validation/test set accuracy on the entire dataset. \\n\\nWe have now included two noise-aware algorithms (MEIDTM, CVPR\\u201922, and Confident Learning, Northcutt et. al. 2022, \\u201cConfident Learning: Estimating Uncertainty in Dataset Labels.\\u201d) in our baselines. In both cases, these approaches estimate a confidence/transition matrix on training samples to determine the probability of error of a sample's label for a given class. We compare against both approaches and find that they both underperform the influence-based approaches on the datasets considered. We updated the text (Appendix F) to discuss these results. \\n\\nAs we previously noted, we caution that such a comparison might not be fair for these algorithms since they were designed for identifying and correcting generic label error instead of those that disproportionately affect a model's disparity metric.\\n\\n\\nThank you for the feedback, we hope we have adequately addressed your concerns. We will be happy to answer any additional questions. We encourage them to reconsider their score in light of our updates. \\n\",\n",

A similar observation has also been made for other algorithmic interventions like Pruning (Tran et. al. 2022, \\u201cPruning has disparate effect on model accuracy\\u201d & Hooker et. al. 2022 \\u201cWhat do deep neural networks forget\\u201d), Differential Privacy (Bagdasaryan et. al. 2018, \\u201cDifferential privacy has disparate impact on model accuracy\\u201d), and Selective Classification (Jones et. al. 2021, \\u201cSelective Classification Can Magnify Disparities Across Groups\\u201d) and adversarial training (Xu et. al. 2021 \\u201cTo be robust or to be fair: Towards fairness in adversarial training\\u201d).\\n\\nTaken together, the results above suggest that our proposed identification and relabelling strategy addresses shortcomings of current noise-aware approaches. We plan to perform a more comprehensive empirical assessment for the final version of the paper.\\n\\n**Clarification of Experimental Setting**\\n1. **Majority Group and Minority Groups:** For each dataset, we have access to feature annotations that partition the dataset into groups. As indicated in Table 1, these annotations are group variables like Sex (Male, Female), and Race. For each group annotation, we can partition the training set into groups; the training subset with the largest size is the majority group, while the training subset with the smallest size is the minority group. We've updated the text to reflect this.\\n2. **Tabular Data:** To train CNNs on tabular data, we first apply a simple 2-layer MLP on the tabular dataset. We then simply extract representations from the hidden layer of the MLP, reshape these to be (32 by 32) two-dimensional and normalized ([0-1]). This strategy has been previously employed to train deep learning models on tabular data previously (Borisov et. al. 2022, \\u201cDeep Neural Networks and Tabular Data: A Survey\\u201d). We've updated the text to clarify this as well.\\n\\nThank you for the feedback, we hope we have adequately addressed your concerns. We will be happy to answer any additional questions.

The authors have empirically illustrated that minority groups are more sensitive to label errors than majority groups. To make the conclusion more meaningful and practical, I think it would be great to add some theoretical analysis on the influence of label errors with different minority and majority group sizes.\\n\\nAs we discussed in the general comment, the three key contributions of this paper address challenges that were previously not understood in the label error literature. Specifically, the effects of label error (noise) on a model's average validation performance, empirically and theoretically, has been studied before. However, little was known, in the literature, about the effect of label error on a broad swath of model disparity metrics. In this paper, we address this challenge. In addition, we have now included a theoretical result that indicates that relabelling the problematic inputs that influence functions prioritizes reduces a model\\u2019s excess risk (under certain assumptions), and hence group calibration. \\n\\n>The proposed method for estimating the \\u2018influence\\u2019 of perturbing a training point\\u2019s label on a disparity metric may not practical.\\n\\nIn recent work, Schioppa et. al. (2022)(Scaling up influence functions) scale influence functions up to large transformer models with about 300 million parameters. To do this, they use Arnoldi iteration to approximate the hessian with a diagonalized matrix that can be easily inverted. Following their approach, we have now switched our implementation to theirs and can confirm that it scales to Resnet-50 models. This means that our approach can be easily applicable to large scale models. \\n\\n> ... needs a lot of retraining processes to detect the effect of all training inputs, which can be hard to apply to a dataset with high-dimensional features.\\n\\nOur proposed approach does not need retraining. As a matter of fact, the influence functions approach was originally developed to help side step the need to retrain models in order to estimate the effect of a training sample. As indicated in Equations 4 and 5 from the text, given an already trained model, we simply need to perform an implicit hessian vector product for each training point. One can iterate through all training points to perform such a product to estimate each point's influence.\\n\\n**Comparison to noise-aware methods**\\\\\\nThank you for sharing the references to these noise-aware methods. We have now incorporated these approaches into our settings. As we note in the contributions, we first identify problematic instances and then relabel these instances to improve the downstream model. \\n\\nThe goal and experimental setting of most noise-aware algorithms differ from our setup in two ways: 1) We are interested in group disparity, so we are focused on settings and datasets that includes a protected group attribute (often Race, Gender, and others in the fairness literature), and 2) We primarily seek to identify the problematic instances that need to be relabelled (often by a human labeler), and not automatically learn a model that is robust to label error. The output of our proposed approach is a set of points that should be relabelled by a human, whereas in noise-aware learning, the goal and output is a new model that is robust to label noise. Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 do not have protected attribute labels, so we did not originally experiment on these datasets.\\n\\nWe have now performed additional experiments using the modified Cifar-10 dataset from Hall et. al. (2022), \\\"A Systematic Study of Bias Amplification\\\". In this paper, the authors modify Cifar-10 to be a binary classification task, and then inject group labels into the two classes by inverting a fraction of the examples in each class. Given a specified parameter $\\\\epsilon \\\\in [0, 1/2]$, a $\\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\epsilon$ of the negative class is inverted, while a $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\epsilon$ of the positive class is inverted leading to $2\\\\epsilon$ fraction of one group of samples and $1-2\\\\epsilon$ of the other group. In all experiments we set $\\\\epsilon=0.15$ for a 30 percent minority group membership.\\n\\nWe replicate our experimental setup on this task where we inject label noise into the training set. We test the MEIDTM, DivideMix, and a robust loss approach. We find consistent results across these approaches (New Figure 4 in text). At a high level, for the majority group, we find that model accuracy and downstream disparity metrics remain resilient to low rates of label error. At higher rates, we start to see declines in these performance metrics. However, for the minority group, the disparity metrics show consistent high sensitivity with increased label error. This finding suggests that noise-aware methods show disparate performance in their ability to confer robustness to label error depending on data group sizes. \\n\",\n",

      "    \"comments\": \"We thank the reviewers for noting that we address an important problem (Xn1n, oCK7), with an interesting analysis (DK6U) that is very well organized, written, and easy to follow (DK6U, oCK7). First, we provide a high-level summary of the changes that we've made to the draft to address your feedback, and conclude with an overview of our key contributions, and how they differ from previous work.\\n___\\n\\nHere is the summary of updates that we've made to the draft: \\n\\n- Added a new section discussing empirical results on the sensitivity of models trained using noise-aware algorithms. The previous disparate effect that we observed for minority groups persists even for models trained with noise-aware algorithms (**Reviewers Xn1n and oCK7**).\\n- Revamped related work section to clarify our findings and differentiate our contributions from previous work. We have also incorporated all the references provided by the reviewers (**Reviewers Xn1n, oCK7, & DK6U**).\\n- Added empirical results on a new image and a text dataset and find that our results remain consistent across these datasets (**Reviewers DK6U**).\\n- Added new noise-aware baselines to label error identification experiments, and show that our proposed approach outperforms these approaches (**Reviewers Xn1n and oCK7**).\\n- Finally, we now provide a theoretical guarantee for the automatic fix proposed in the work. This theorem suggests that our proposed relabeling leads to models with provably improved group calibration (**Reviewers Xn1n and oCK7**).\\n\\nTo end this update, we discuss a common concern across all reviewers.\\n\\n**Novelty and Technical insight**\\\\\\nThe impact of label error on model accuracy is a well-studied problem. However, the effect of label error on a model's disparity metrics is still poorly understood in the literature. Performance metrics estimated on the entire validation (or test) set are typically invalid for more fine-grained groups in the dataset (See: Distributionally Robust Losses for Latent Covariate Mixtures, Duchi et. al. 2022). Consequently, we cannot expect results on the effect of label error on validation loss (or other performance metrics) to provide insights on how label error affects group calibration and other disparity metrics. Consequently, in this paper we characterize the impact of label error on these disparity metrics. \\n\\nTo contextualize the results in this paper, we now summarize our key contributions:\\n\\n1. **Empirical demonstration of sensitivity of a model's disparity metrics to label error:** First, we find that a model's group-based disparity metrics are sensitive to the presence of label error in either the training and/or test data. In particular, we find that such sensitivity is more pronounced for samples in the minority group in the data. We have now conducted additional experiments that also show that such sensitivity remains unaffected, for minority groups, even when models are trained with noise-aware algorithms. Consequently, our findings suggest that the presence of label error can render the results of a fairness audit unreliable. \\n2. **Approach to identify training inputs whose labels have high effect on any differentiable disparity metric:** Having established that a model's disparity metric is sensitive to label error, we then provide a way to identify the training samples whose wrong labels have the most influence on any differentiable disparity metric of interest. Our proposed formulation departs from previous approaches in a few ways. First, as we show in the results of Figure 4, simply prioritizing samples based on standard versions of training sample influence often identifies training samples in the majority class. Hence, the effect of label error on the minority group, the group most disproportionately affected, is often ignored with naive influence-based ranking. Second, we consider a more fine grained notion of influence where we characterize the impact of the change in label on the disparity metric of interest. Both of these specializations enable improved performance as the ablation on Figure 4 shows, and depart from the way influence functions were previously used in the literature.\\n3. **Correcting Label Error:** Lastly, in Section 5.2, we present an automatic relabel-and-finetune scheme that produces updated models with improved group calibration error. We compare this strategy to several others (now including noise-aware baselines), and find that our approach outperforms these other strategies. In addition, we now provide a theorem that demonstrates that the proposed strategy provably improves group calibration.\\n\\nTaken together, these contributions represent novel insights to the literature on the effect of label error on a model\\u2019s disparity metrics.\",\n",

They try to answer two significant questions regarding label errors and fairness:\\n    What is the sensitivity of a model\\u2019s disparity metric to label errors in training and test data? Does the effect of label error vary based on group size?\\n    How can a practitioner identify training points whose labels have the most influence on a model\\u2019s group disparity metric?\\n2. Various disparity metrics, models, and datasets are considered\\n    model disparity metrics: expected calibration error (ECE), the Brier Score (BS), False Positive Rate (FPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), and Error Rate (ER).\\n    datasets across different modalities: 4 tabular, and a text dataset.\\n    models: a logistic regression model, a Gradient-boosted Tree (GBT), and ResNet-18.\\n3. The closed form influence function is potentially useful for regularizing or mitigating the label error while training.\\n\\nWeaknesses\\n1. Although multiple datasets are used, how to make sure that the conclusions and analysis drawn is not dataset-specific is still an open question.\\n2.
