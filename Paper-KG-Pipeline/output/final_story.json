  "title": "Autoregressive Image Diffusion for Sequence-Aware Posterior Sampling in Accelerated MRI Reconstruction",
  "abstract": "Accelerated MRI reconstruction requires recovering high-fidelity images from undersampled data, a task complicated by the need to preserve temporal coherence in dynamic sequences. We propose the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) model, a novel framework designed for image sequence generation that effectively captures temporal dependencies. To address the prohibitive computational cost of diffusion sampling in clinical settings, we integrate advanced numerical solvers, specifically exponential integrators and quasi-Taylor schemes, into the AID framework. This approach transforms the diffusion sampling process from a slow stochastic trajectory into a fast, deterministic path. By applying AID to sample the posterior distribution, we achieve rapid, high-quality reconstruction of MRI sequences, outperforming traditional methods in both efficiency and temporal consistency.",
  "problem_framing": "We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a static, pixel-wise optimization task to a dynamic sequence generation problem requiring coherent temporal modeling. Traditional approaches treat MRI frames independently, failing to leverage the rich temporal information inherent in dynamic scans. Furthermore, the application of diffusion models to this inverse problem is often hindered by the slow, iterative nature of the sampling process. By shifting the focus to autoregressive generation within the diffusion framework, we address the dual challenge of maintaining spatiotemporal consistency while ensuring the computational feasibility of posterior sampling.",
  "gap_pattern": "Existing methods for MRI reconstruction utilizing diffusion models are primarily designed for static images, lacking the mechanism to handle sequential data autoregressively. Moreover, standard diffusion samplers rely on hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations, making posterior sampling for MRI prohibitively expensive. Current efficient sampling techniques have not been adapted to the autoregressive context, leaving a critical gap where the temporal dynamics of sequences cannot be modeled efficiently without sacrificing reconstruction speed or quality.",
  "solution": "Our solution introduces the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) model, which specifically targets image sequence generation by conditioning the denoising process on previous latent states. To realize the goal of practical MRI reconstruction, we employ the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) and quasi-Taylor schemes as the numerical engine. These techniques leverage the semilinear structure of diffusion processes to minimize discretization error, allowing us to drastically reduce the number of sampling steps. This integration transforms AID from a conceptual generative model into a practical tool for accelerated MRI, enabling fast, deterministic posterior sampling that preserves the sequential fidelity of the anatomical data.",
  "method_skeleton": "Construct the AID architecture by incorporating an autoregressive conditioning module that integrates the latent state of the previous time step into the score network for current frame prediction; Implement the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) to discretize the probability flow ODE, utilizing the analytical solution of the linear part to achieve high-order accuracy with fewer steps; Formulate the MRI reconstruction as a posterior sampling problem by conditioning the AID model on undersampled k-space data using a gradient-based guidance step; Employ a quasi-Taylor sampler with ideal derivative substitution to further accelerate the generation of high-frequency details in the MRI sequences.",
