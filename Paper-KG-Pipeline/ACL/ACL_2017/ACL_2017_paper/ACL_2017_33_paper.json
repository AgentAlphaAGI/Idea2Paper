      "text" : "Sentiment classification aims to classify text to sentiment classes such as positive or negative, or more fine-grained classes such as very positive, positive, neutral, etc. There has been a variety of approaches for this purpose such as lexicon-based classification (Turney, 2002; Taboada et al., 2011), and early machine learning based methods (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2005), and recently neural network models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) (Kim, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2015), recursive autoencoders (Socher et al., 2011, 2013), Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) (Mikolov, 2012; Chung et al., 2014; Tai et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015), and many more.\nIn spite of the great success of these neural models, there are some defects in previous studies.\nFirst, tree-structured models such as recursive autoencoders and Tree-LSTM (Tai et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015), depend on parsing tree structures and expensive phrase-level annotation, whose performance drops substantially when only trained with sentence-level annotation. Second, linguistic knowledge such as sentiment lexicon, negation words or negators (e.g., not, never), and intensity words or intensifiers (e.g., very, absolutely), has not been fully employed in neural models.\nThe goal of this research is to developing simple sequence models but also attempts to fully employing linguistic resources to benefit sentiment classification. Firstly, we attempts to develop simple models that do not depend on parsing trees and do not require phrase-level annotation which is too expensive in real-world applications. Secondly, in order to obtain competitive performance, simple models can benefit from linguistic resources. Three types of resources will be addressed in this paper: sentiment lexicon, negation words, and intensity words. Sentiment lexicon offers the prior polarity of a word which can be useful in determining the sentiment polarity of longer texts such as phrases and sentences. Negators are typical sentiment shifters (Zhu et al., 2014), which constantly change the polarity of sentiment expression. Intensifiers change the valence degree of the modified text, which is important for fine-grained sentiment classification.\nIn order to model the linguistic role of sentiment, negation, and intensity words, our central idea is to regularize the difference between the predicted sentiment distribution of the current position 1, and that of the previous or next positions, in a sequence model. For instance, if the current position is a negator not, the negator should change the sentiment distribution of the next posi-\n1Note that in sequence models, the hidden state of the current position also encodes forward or backward contexts.\ntion accordingly. To summarize, our contributions lie in two folds:\n• We discover that modeling the linguistic role of sentiment, negation, and intensity words can enhance sentence-level sentiment classification. We address the issue by imposing linguistic-inspired regularizers on sequence LSTM models.\n• Unlike previous models that depend on parsing structures and expensive phrase-level annotation, our models are simple and efficient, but the performance is on a par with the stateof-the-art.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In the following section, we survey related work. In Section 3, we briefly introduce the background of LSTM and bidirectional LSTM, and then describe in detail the lingistic regularizers for sentiment/negation/intensity words in Section 4. Experiments are presented in Section 5, and Conclusion follows in Section 6."

      "text" : "There are many neural networks proposed for sentiment classification. The most noticeable models may be the recursive autoencoder neural network which builds the representation of a sentence from subphrases recursively (Socher et al., 2011, 2013; Dong et al., 2014; Qian et al., 2015). Such recursive models usually depend on a tree structure of input text, and in order to obtain competitive results, usually require annotation of all subphrases. Sequence models, for instance, convolutional neural network (CNN), do not require tree-structured data, which are widely adopted for sentiment classification (Kim, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2015). Long short-term memory models are also common for learning sentence-level representation due to its capability of modeling the prefix or suffix context (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). LSTM can be commonly applied to sequential data but also tree-structured data (Zhu et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2015)."

      "text" : "Linguistic knowledge and sentiment resources, such as sentiment lexicons, negation words (not,\nnever, neither, etc.) or negators, and intensity words (very, extremely, etc.) or intensifiers, are useful for sentiment analysis in general.\nSentiment lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005) usually defines prior polarity of a lexical entry, and is valuable for lexicon-based models (Turney, 2002; Taboada et al., 2011), and machine learning approaches (Pang and Lee, 2008). There are recent works for automatic construction of sentiment lexicons from social data (Vo and Zhang, 2016) and for multiple languages (Chen and Skiena, 2014). A noticeable work that ultilizes sentiment lexicons can be seen in (Teng et al., 2016) which treats the sentiment score of a sentence as a weighted sum of prior sentiment scores of negation words and sentiment words, where the weights are learned by a neural network.\nNegation words play a critical role in modifying sentiment of textual expressions. Some early negation models adopt the reversing assumption that a negator reverses the sign of the sentiment value of the modified text (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006). The shifting hyothesis assumes that negators change the sentiment values by a constant amount (Taboada et al., 2011; Liu and Seneff, 2009). Since each negator can affect the modified text in different ways, the constant amount can be extended to be negatorspecific (Zhu et al., 2014), and further, the effect of negators could also depend on the syntax and semantics of the modified text (Zhu et al., 2014). Other approaches to negation modeling can be seen in (Jia et al., 2009; Wiegand et al., 2010; Benamara et al., 2012; Lapponi et al., 2012).\nSentiment intensity of a phrase indicates the strength of associated sentiment, which is quite important for fine-grained sentiment classification or rating. Intensity words can change the valence degree (i.e., sentiment intensity) of the modified text. In (Wei et al., 2011) the authors propose a linear regression model to predict the valence value for content words. In (Malandrakis et al., 2013), a kernel-based model is proposed to combine semantic information for predicting sentiment score. In the SemEval-2016 task 7 subtask A, a learningto-rank model with a pair-wise strategy is proposed to predict sentiment intensity scores (Wang et al., 2016). Linguistic intensity is not limited to sentiment or intensity words, and there are works that assign low/medium/high intensity scales to adjectives such as okay, good, great (Sharma et al.,\n2015) or to gradable terms (e.g. large, huge, gigantic) (Shivade et al., 2015).\nIn (Dong et al., 2015), a sentiment parser is proposed, and the authors studied how sentiment changes when a phrase is modified by negators or intensifiers."

The forward and backward LSTMs are respectively formulated as follows:\n−→c t, −→ h t = g (LSTM)(−→c t−1, −→ h t−1, xt) (2)\n←−c t, ←− h t = g (LSTM)(←−c t+1, ←− h t+1, xt) (3)\nwhere g(LSTM) is the same as that in Eq (1).

In this way, the forward and backward contexts can be considered simultaneously."

      "text" : "The central idea of the paper is to model the linguistic role of sentiment, negation, and intensity words in sentence-level sentiment classification by\nregularizing the outputs at adjacent positions of a sentence. For example, in sentence “this movie is interesting”, the predicted sentiment distributions at “this*2”, “this movie*”, and “this movie is*” should be close to each other, while the predicted sentiment distribution at “this movie is very interesting*” should be quite different from the preceeding positions (“this movie is very*”) since a sentiment word (“interesting”) is seen.\nWe propose a generic regularizer and three special regularizers based on the following linguistic observations:\n• Non-Sentiment Regularizer: if the two adjacent positions are all non-opinion words, the sentiment distributions of the two positions should be close to each other. Though this is not always true (e.g., soap movie), this assumption holds at most cases.\n• Sentiment Regularizer: if the word is a sentiment word found in a lexicon, the sentiment distribution of the current position should be significantly different from that of the next or previous positions. We approach this phenomenon with a sentiment class specific shifting distribution.\n• Negation Regularizer: Negation words such as “not” and “never” are critical sentiment shifter or converter: in general they shift sentiment polarity from the positive end to the negative end, but sometimes depend on the negation word and the words they modify. The negation regularizer models this linguistic phenomena with a negator-specific transformation matrix.\n• Intensity Regularizer: Intensity words such as “very” and “extremely” change the valence degree of a sentiment expression: for instance, from positive to very positive. Modeling this effect is quite important for finegrained sentiment classification, and the intensity regularizer is designed to formulate this effect by a word-specific transformation matrix.\nMore formally, the predicted sentiment distribution (pt, based on ht, see Eq. 5) at position t should be linguistically regularized with respect to that of the preceding (t − 1) or following (t + 1)\n2The asterisk denotes the current position.\npositions. In order to enforce the model to produce coherent predictions, we plug a new loss term into the original cross entropy loss:\nL(θ) = − ∑ i yi log pi + α ∑ i ∑ t Lt,i + β||θ||2 (4)\nwhere yi is the gold distribution for sentence i, pi is the predicted distribution, Lt,i is one of the above regularizers or combination of these regularizers on sentence i, α is the weight for the regularization term, and t is the word position in a sentence.\nNote that we do not consider the modification span of negation and intensity words to preserve the simplicity of the proposed models. Negation scope resolution is another complex problem which has been extensively studied (Zou et al., 2013; Packard et al., 2014; Fancellu et al., 2016), which is beyond the scope of this work. Instead, we resort to sequence LSTMs for encoding surrounding contexts at a given position."

Let’s revisit the example “this movie is interesting” again. At position t = 4 we see a positive word “interesting” so the predicted distribution would be more positive than that at position t = 3. This is the issue of sentiment drift.\nIn order to address the sentiment drift issue, we propose a polarity shifting distribution sc ∈ RC for each sentiment class defined in a lexicon. For\ninstance, a sentiment lexicon may have class labels like strong positive, weakly positive, weakly negative, and strong negative, and for each class, there is a shifting distribution which will be learned by the model. The sentiment regularizer states that if the current word is a sentiment word, the sentiment distribution drift should be observed in comparison to the previous position, in more details:\np (SR) t−1 = pt−1 + sc(xt) (7)\nL (SR) t = max(0, DKL(pt||p (SR) t−1 )−M) (8)\nwhere p(SR)t−1 is the drifted sentiment distribution after considering the shifting sentiment distribution corresponding to the state at position t, c(xt) is the prior sentiment class of word xt, and sc ∈ θ is a parameter to be optimized but could also be set fixed with prior knowledge. Note that in this way all words of the same sentiment class share the same drifting distribution, but in a refined setting, we can learn a shifting distribution for each sentiment word if large-scale datasets are available."

When the input xt is a negation word, the sentiment distribution should be shifted/reversed accordingly. However, the negation role is more complex than that by sentiment words, for example, the word “not” in “not good” and “not bad” have different roles in polarity change. The former changes the polarity to negative, while the latter changes to neutral instead of positive.\nTo respect such complex negation effects, we propose a transformation matrix Tm ∈ RC×C for each negation word m, and the matrix will be learned by the model. The regularizer assumes that if the current position is a negation word, the sentiment distribution of the current position should be close to that of the next or previous position with the transformation.\np (NR) t−1 = softmax(Txj × pt−1) (9)\np (NR) t+1 = softmax(Txj × pt+1) (10)\nL (NR) t = min\n{ max(0, DKL(pt||p(NR)t−1 )−M)\nmax(0, DKL(pt||p(NR)t+1 )−M) (11)\nwhere p(NR)t−1 and p (NR) t+1 is the sentiment distuibution after transformation, Txj ∈ θ is the transformation matrix for a negation word xj , a parameter to be learned during training.

However, we can alleviate the problem by leveraging bidirectional LSTM.\nFor a single LSTM, we employ a backward LSTM from the end to the beginning of a sentence. This is because, at most times, the modified words of negation and intensity words are usually at the right side of the modified text. But sometimes, the modified words are at the left side of negation and intensity words. To better address this issue, we employ bidirectional LSTM and let the model determine which side should be chosen.\nMore formally, in Bi-LSTM, we compute a transformed sentiment distribution on−→p t−1 of the forward LSTM and also that on←−p t+1 of the backward LSTM, and compute the minimum distance of the distribution of the current position to the two distributions. This could be formulated as follows:\n−→p (R)t−1 = softmax(Txj × −→p t−1) (12)\n←−p (R)t+1 = softmax(Txj × ←−p t+1) (13)\nL (R) t = min\n{ max(0, DKL( −→p t||−→p (R)t−1)−M)\nmax(0, DKL( ←−p t||←−p (R)t+1)−M)\n(14)\nwhere −→p (R)t−1 and ←−p (R)t+1 are the sentiment distributions transformed from the previous distribution −→p t−1 and next distribution ←−p t+1 respectively.

In the sentiment regularizer, the sentiment shifting effect is parameterized with a classspecific distribution (but could also be wordspecific if with more data). In the negation and intensity regularizers, the effect is parameterized with word-specific transformation matrices. This is to respect the fact that the mechanism of how negation and intensity words shift sentiment expression is quite complex and highly dependent on individual words. Negation/Intensity effect also depends on the syntax and semantics of the modified text, however, for simplicity we resort to sequence LSTM for encoding surrounding contexts in this paper.

Note that SST has provided phrase-level annotation on all inner nodes, but we only use the sentence-level annotation since one of our goals is to avoid expensive phrase-level annotation.\nThe sentiment lexicon contains two parts. The first part comes from MPQA (Wilson et al., 2005), which contains 5, 153 sentiment words, each with polarity rating. The second part consists of the leaf nodes of the SST dataset (i.e., all sentiment words) and there are 6, 886 polar words except neural ones. We combine the two parts and ignore those words that have conflicting sentiment labels, and produce a lexicon of 9, 750 words with 4 sentiment labels.

It’s worth noting that LR-Bi-LSTM (trained with just sentence-level annotation) is even comparable to Bi-LSTM trained with phrase-level annotation.

For instance, the number 20 (m21) in the second matrix , means that there are 20 phrases predicted with a class of negative (-) but the prediction changes to very negative (- -) after being modified by intensifier “very”. Results in the first matrix show that, for intensifier “most”, there are 21/21/13/12 phrases whose sentiment is shifted after being modified by intensifiers, from negative\nto very negative (eg. most irresponsible picture), positive to very positive (eg. most famous author), neutral to negative (eg. most plain), and neutral to positive (eg. most closely), respectively.\nThere are also many phrases retaining the sentiment after being modified with intensifiers.

In this paper, we propose simple models trained with sentence-level annotation, but also attempt to model the linguistic role of sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words. Results show that our models are able to capture the linguistic role of sentiment words, negation words, and intensity words in sentiment expression.",
