      "text" : "Network embedding (NE), i.e., network representation learning (NRL), aims to map vertices of a network into a low-dimensional space according to their structural roles in the network. NE provides an efficient and effective way to represent and manage large-scale networks, alleviating the computation and sparsity issues of conventional symbol-based representations. Hence, NE is attracting many research interests in recent years (Perozzi et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015; Grover and\nLeskovec, 2016), and achieves promising performance on many network analysis tasks including link prediction, vertex classification, and community detection.\nIn real-world social networks, it is intuitive that one vertex may demonstrate various aspects when interacting with different neighbor vertices. For example, a researcher usually collaborates with different partners on diverse research topics (as illustrated in Fig. 1), a social-media user contacts with various friends sharing distinct interests, and a web page links with multiple pages for different purposes. However, most existing NE methods only arrange one single embedding vector to each vertex, and give rise to the following two invertible issues: (1) These methods cannot cope with the aspect transition of a vertex flexibly when interacting with different neighbors. (2) In these models, a vertex tends to force the embeddings of its neighbors close to each other, which may be not case all the time. For example, the left user and right user in Fig. 1, share less common interests, but are learned to be close to each other since they both link to the middle person. This will accordingly\nmake vertex embeddings indiscriminative. To address these issues, we aim to propose a Context-Aware Network Embedding (CANE) framework for modeling relationships between vertices precisely. More specifically, we present CANE on information networks, where each vertex also contains rich external information such as text, labels or other meta-data, and the significance of context is more critical for NE in this scenario. Without loss of generality, we implement CANE on text-based information networks in this paper, which can be easily extended to other types of information networks.\nIn conventional NE models, each vertex is represented as a static embedding vector, denoted as context-free embedding. On the contrary, CANE assigns dynamic embeddings to a vertex according to different neighbors it interacts with, named as context-aware embedding . Take a vertex u and its neighbor vertex v for example. The contextfree embedding of u remains unchanged when interacting with different neighbors. On the contrary, the context-aware embedding of u is dynamic when confronting different neighbors.\nWhen u interacting with v, their context embeddings with respect to each other are derived from their text information, Su and Sv respectively. For each vertex, we can easily use neural models, such as convolutional neural networks (Blunsom et al., 2014; Johnson and Zhang, 2014; Kim, 2014) and recurrent neural networks (Kiros et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2015), to build context-free text-based embedding. In order to realize context-aware textbased embeddings, we introduce the selective attention scheme and build mutual attention between u and v into these neural models. The mutual attention is expected to guide neural models to emphasize those words that are focused by its neighbor vertices and eventually obtain contextaware embeddings.\nBoth context-free embeddings and contextaware embeddings of each vertex can be efficiently learned together via concatenation using existing NE methods such as DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), LINE (Tang et al., 2015) and node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016).\nWe conduct experiments on three real-world datasets of different areas. Experimental results on link prediction reveal the effectiveness of our framework as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The results suggest that, context-aware\nembeddings are critical for network analysis, especially for those tasks concerning about complicated interactions between vertices such as link prediction. We also explore the performance of our framework via vertex classification and case studies, which again confirms the flexibility and superiority of our models."

      "text" : "With the rapid growth of large-scale social networks, network embedding, i.e. network representation learning has been proposed as a critical technique for network analysis tasks.\nIn recent years, there have been a large number of NE models proposed to learn efficient vertex embeddings (Tang and Liu, 2009; Cao et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016). For example, DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) performs random walks over networks and introduces an efficient word representation learning model, Skip-Gram (Mikolov et al., 2013a), to learn network embeddings. LINE (Tang et al., 2015) optimizes the joint and conditional probabilities of edges in large-scale networks to learn vertex representations. Node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016) modifies the random walk strategy in DeepWalk into biased random walks to explore the network structure more efficiently. Nevertheless, most of these NE models only encode the structural information into vertex embeddings, without considering heterogenous information accompanied with vertices in real-world social networks.\nTo address this issue, researchers make great efforts to incorporate heterogenous information into conventional NE models. For instance, Yang et al. (2015) present text-associated DeepWalk (TADW) to improve matrix factorization based DeepWalk with text information. Tu et al. (2016) propose max-margin DeepWalk (MMDW) to learn discriminative network representations by utilizing labeling information of vertices. Chen et al. (2016) propose group-enhanced network embedding (GENE) to integrate existing group information in NE. Sun et al. (2016) regard text content as a special kind of vertices, and propose contextenhanced network embedding (CENE) through leveraging both structural and textural information to learn network embeddings.\nTo the best of our knowledge, all existing NE models focus on learning context-free embeddings, but ignore the diverse roles when a vertex\ninteracts with others. In contrast, we assume that a vertex has different embeddings according to which vertex it interacts with, and propose CANE to learn context-aware vertex embeddings."

Suppose there is an information network G = (V,E, T ), where V is the set of vertices, E ⊆ V ×V are edges between vertices, and T denotes the text information of vertices. Each edge eu,v ∈ E represents the relationship between two vertices (u, v), with an associated weight wu,v. Here, the text information of a specific vertex v ∈ V is represented as a word sequence Sv = (w1, w2, . . . , wnv), where nv = |Sv|. NRL aims to learn a low-dimensional embedding v ∈ Rd for each vertex v ∈ V according to its network structure and associated information, e.g. text and labels. Note that, d |V | is the dimension of representation space.\nDefinition 1. Context-free Embeddings: Conventional NRL models learn context-free embedding for each vertex. It means the embedding of a vertex is fixed and won’t change with respect to its context information (i.e., another vertex it interacts with).\nDefinition 2. Context-aware Embeddings: Different from existing NRL models that learn context-free embeddings, CANE learns various embeddings for a vertex according to its different contexts. Specifically, for an edge eu,v, CANE learns context-aware embeddings v(u) and u(v)."

      "text" : "To take full use of both network structure and associated text information, we propose two types of embeddings for a vertex v, i.e., structurebased embedding vs and text-based embedding vt. Structure-based embedding is able to capture the information in the network structure, while text-based embedding can capture the textual meanings lying in the associated text information. With these embeddings, we can simply concatenate them and obtain the vertex embeddings as v = vs⊕vt, where ⊕ indicates the concatenation operation. Note that, the text-based embedding vt can be either context-free or context-aware, which will be introduced detailedly in section 4.4 and 4.5\nrespectively. When vt is context-aware, the overall vertex embeddings v will be context-aware as well.\nWith above definitions, CANE aims to maximize the overall objective of edges as follows:\nL = ∑ e∈E L(e). (1)\nHere, the objective of each edge L(e) consists of two parts as follows:\nL(e) = Ls(e) + Lt(e), (2)\nwhere Ls(e) denotes the structure-based objective and Lt(e) represents the text-based objective.\nIn the following part, we give detailed introduction to the two objectives respectively."

      "text" : "There has been a variety of neural models to obtain text embeddings from a word sequence, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) (Blunsom et al., 2014; Johnson and Zhang, 2014; Kim, 2014) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Kiros et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2015).\nIn this work, we investigate different neural networks for text modeling, including CNN, Bidirectional RNN (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997) and GRU (Cho et al., 2014), and employ the best performed CNN, which can capture the local semantic dependency among words.\nTaking the word sequence of a vertex as input, CNN obtains the text-based embedding through three layers, i.e. looking-up, convolution and pooling.\nLooking-up. Given a word sequence S = (w1, w2, . . . , wn), the looking-up layer transforms each word wi ∈ S into its corresponding word embedding wi ∈ Rd ′ and obtains embedding sequence as S = (w1,w2, . . . ,wn). Here, d′ indicates the dimension of word embeddings.\nConvolution. After looking-up, the convolution layer extracts local features of input embedding sequence S. To be specific, it performs convolution operation over a sliding window of length l using a convolution matrix C ∈ Rd×(l×d′) as follows:\nxi = C · Si:i+l−1 + b, (7)\nwhere Si:i+l−1 denotes the concatenation of word embeddings within the i-th window and b is the bias vector. Note that, we add zero padding vectors (Hu et al., 2014) at the edge of the sentence.\nMax-pooling. To obtain the text embedding vt, we operate max-pooling and non-linear transfor-\nmation over {xi0, . . . ,xin} as follows:\nri = tanh(max(x i 0, . . . ,x i n)), (8)\nAt last, we encode the text information of a vertex with CNN and obtain its text-based embedding vt = [r1, . . . , rd]\nT . As vt is irrelevant to the other vertices it interacts with, we name it as contextfree text embedding."

      "text" : "As stated before, we assume that a specific vertex plays different roles when interacting with others vertices. In other words, each vertex should have its own points of focus about a specific vertex, which leads to its context-aware text embeddings.\nTo achieve this, we employ mutual attention to obtain context-aware text embedding. It enables the pooling layer in CNN to be aware of the vertex pair in an edge, in a way that text information from a vertex can directly affect the text embedding of the other vertex, and vice versa.\nIn Fig. 2, we give an illustration of the generating process of context-aware text embedding. Given an edge eu,v with two corresponding text sequences Su and Sv, we can get the matrices P ∈ Rd×m and Q ∈ Rd×n through convolution layer. Here, m and n represent the lengths of Su\nand Sv respectively. By introducing an attentive matrix A ∈ Rd×d, we compute the correlation matrix F ∈ Rm×n as follows:\nF = tanh(PTAQ). (9)\nNote that, each element Fi,j in F represents the pair-wise correlation score between two hidden vectors, i.e., Pi and Qj .\nAfter that, we conduct pooling operations along rows and columns of F to generate the importance vectors, named as row-pooling and column pooling respectively. According to our experiments, mean-pooling performs better than max-pooling. Thus, we employ mean-pooling operation as follows:\ngpi = mean(Fi,1, . . . ,Fi,n), gqi = mean(F1,i, . . . ,Fm,i). (10)\nThe importance vectors of P and Q are obtained as gp = [gp1 , . . . , g p m]T and gq = [gq1, . . . , g q n]T .\nNext, we employ softmax function to transform importance vectors gp and gq to attention vectors ap and aq. For instance, the i-th element of ap is formalized as follows:\napi = exp(gpi )∑\nj∈[1,m] exp(g p j ) . (11)\nAt last, the context-aware text embeddings of u and v are computed as\nut(v) = Pa p, vt(u) = Qa q.\n(12)\nNow, given an edge (u, v), we can obtain the context-aware embeddings of vertices with their structure embeddings and context-aware text embeddings as u(v) = us⊕ut(v) and v(u) = v s⊕vt(u)."

It indicates the effectiveness of CANE when applied to link prediction task, and verifies that CANE has the capability of modeling relationships between vertices precisely.\n(2) What calls for special attention is that, both CENE and TADW exhibit unstable performance under various training ratios. Specifically, CENE performs poorly under small training ratios, because it reserves much more parameters (e.g., convolution kernels and word embeddings) than TADW, which need more data for training. Different from CENE, TADW performs much better under small training ratios, because DeepWalk based methods can explore the sparse network structure well through random walks even with limited edges. However, it achieves poor performance\nunder large ones, as its simplicity and the limitation of bag-of-words assumption. On the contrary, CANE has a stable performance on various situations.

It verifies our assumption that a specific vertex should play different roles when interacting with other vertices, and thus benefits the relevant link prediction task.\nTo summarize, all the above observations demonstrate that CANE is able to learn highquality context-aware embeddings, which are conducive to estimating the relationship between vertices precisely.

However, existing NE models aim to learn a fixed context-free embedding for each vertex, and neglect the diverse roles when interacting with other vertices. In this paper, we assume that one vertex usually shows different aspects when interacting with different neighbor vertices, and should own different embeddings respectively. Therefore, we present ContextAware Network Embedding (CANE), a novel NE model to address this issue. CANE learns context-aware embeddings for vertices with mutual attention mechanism and is expected to model the semantic relationships between vertices more precisely. In experiments, we compare our model with existing NE models on three real-world datasets. Experimental results shows that CANE achieves significant improvement than state-of-the-art methods on link prediction, and comparable performance on vertex classification.",
