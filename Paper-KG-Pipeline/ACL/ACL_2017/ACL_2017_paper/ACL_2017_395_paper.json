      "text" : "Recently, deep learning methodologies have dominated several research areas in natural language processing (NLP), such as machine translation, language understanding, and dialogue systems. However, most of applications usually utilize word-level embeddings to obtain semantics. Considering that natural language is highly ambiguous, the standard word embeddings may suffer from polysemy issues. Neelakantan et al. (2014) pointed out that, due to triangle inequality in vector space, if one word embedding has two different senses, the sum of the distance between the word embedding and its synonymous embedding in each sense would be larger or equal to the distance between these synonymous embed-\ndings1. Because this inaccurate distance measurement may degrade downstream NLP tasks, multisense word representations are proposed to address the ambiguity issue in a single word embedding scenario (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010; Huang et al., 2012)\nThis paper proposes DRL-Sense—a novel reinforcement learning based framework for learning multi-sense representations, which is composed by two main modules: a sense selection module for inferring the most probable sense for a word given its context, and a sense representation module for representing word senses in a continuous space. Our modular design implements pure sense-level representation learning while maintaining linear time sense selection. The proposed model is optimized by reinforcement learning and incorporates a non-parametric algorithms and a sense exploration mechanism without changing the network architecture2. Our contributions are four-fold: • We are among the first to study reinforcement\nlearning for sense embedding learning, taking account of the Markov property in sense selection given local contexts. • DRL-Sense is the first system that achieves\npure sense-level representation learning with linear time complexity on sense selection. • We develop non-parametric learning and\nsense exploration mechanisms for a general neural sense selection module to achieve better flexibility and robustness. • Our experimental results show the state-of-\nthe-art performance on contextual word similarities and comparable performance with word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013b) using only 1/100 size of training data.\n1d(bank, finance) + d(bank, coast) ≥ d(finance, coast) 2The code will be released after the paper gets accepted."

      "text" : "There are three dominant types of approaches for learning multi-sense word representations in the literature: 1) clustering methods, 2) probabilistic modeling methods, and 3) lexical ontology based methods. Our reinforcement learning based approach can be loosely connected to clustering methods and probabilistic modeling methods.\nReisinger and Mooney (2010) is the first work to propose multi-sense word representations on vector space based on clustering techniques. With the power of deep learning, some work exploit neural networks to learn embeddings with senseannotated corpus based on clustering (Huang et al., 2012; Neelakantan et al., 2014). Chen et al. (2014) replaced the clustering procedure with a word sense disambiguation model based on WordNet (Miller, 1995). Kågebäck et al. (2015) further exploited a weighting mechanism on context in the clustering procedure and evaluated their system on word sense induction. Vu and Parker (2016) proposed an iterative process on the twostage clustering-embedding learning framework. Moreover, Guo et al. (2014) leveraged bilingual resources to perform clustering. However, most of the above approaches separates the clustering procedure and the representation learning procedure, which may suffer from the error propagation issue. Instead, our reinforcement learning model utilizes a reward signal to propagate the statistical information from sense representations to optimize sense selection.\nIn order to make the model more flexible, probabilistic modeling methods are usually utilized for learning multi-sense emnbeddings, where Tian et al. (2014) and Jauhar et al. (2015) conducted probabilistic modeling with EM training. Li and Jurafsky (2015) exploited the Chinese Restaurant Process and demonstrates efficacy of multi-sense word representations on several downstream NLP tasks. Furthermore, Bartunov et al. (2016) developed a non-parametric Bayesian extension on the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013b). However, all above methods fail to maintain pure sense-level representation learning due to the complicated computation in their EM algorithms (Bartunov et al., 2016), where sense-level embeddings are trained with word-level embeddings.\nRecently, Qiu et al. (2016) proposed an EM algorithm to learn representations without wordlevel embeddings, where the computational cost\nis high when selecting the sense identity sequence because the time for searching all sense combination within a context window is exponential. In contrast, by exploiting embeddings in the sense selection module, our model performs linear time sense selection, while maintaining a pure senselevel representation learning module. Another difference between the prior work and ours is that, Qiu et al. (2016) used WordNet (Miller, 1995) to obtain the number of senses for words, and our solution supports non-parametric learning for automatically deciding the sense number of each word.\nFurthermore, most related work either directly exploited sense representations (Neelakantan et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2016) or combined with online expectation sense counts (Li and Jurafsky, 2015; Jauhar et al., 2015) to select senses. The proposed approach incorporates a sense selection module, which can be learned together with the representation learning module through reinforcement learning.\nUnlike a lot of relevant work that requires additional resources such as the lexical ontology (Rothe and Schütze, 2015; Jauhar et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Iacobacci et al., 2015) or bilingual data (Guo et al., 2014; Ettinger et al., 2016; Šuster et al., 2016), which may not be available in the target task, our model can be trained on the corpus only. Also, some prior work proposed to learn topical embeddings and word embeddings jointly in order to consider the contexts (Liu et al., 2015a,b), whereas this paper focuses on learning multi-sense word embeddings."

      "text" : "This work proposes a framework to learn two key modules for multi-sense word representations: a sense selection module and a sense representation module. The sense selection module decides which sense to use given a text context, whereas the sense representation module learns meaningful representation for sense by their statistical characteristics.\nConsidering that the sense representation module requires the sense identity of each word from the sense selection module, and the sense selection module may also benefit from the semantics carried by sense representations, these two modules should be tangled. Hence, a naive two-stage algorithm or two separate learning algorithms proposed by prior work are not optimal. We propose\nto learn two modules in a reinforcement learning manner by introducing a novel reward passing procedure to enable joint training. In addition, a nonparametric learning algorithm is incorporated to enable automatic sense induction, where the number of senses for each word is not predefined but automatically learned for practical usage. Also, simple mechanisms are applied to allow the sense exploration while incorporating the sense selection prior."

      "text" : "The sense selection module decides the sense for a word given its context. Assuming that a word sense is determined by the local context, we use the Markov property to formulate the sense selection module as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to infer the most probable sense based on its local context. Given a corpus C and a context window m, we extract a local context C̄t = {Ct−m, ..., Ct−1, Ct+1, ..., Ct+m} as a state St, and the selection of a sense zik ∈ Zi for a word wi = Ct given context C̄t as an action Aik given the state St, where Zi is the set of senses of word wi. However, this formulation lacks a central element of MDP: a reward signal for measuring the fitness of the selected sense zik. Therefore, if we have meaningful sense representations containing statistical estimation, we can use the estimation as a surrogate reward to simulate the reward signal in the sense selection module."

      "text" : "A successful sense selection module can be applied to each word in a corpus for obtaining its sense identity. Various techniques about word embeddings can be directly employed after mapping all words in a corpus to its sense identity. The typical method is to formulate the sense selection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem for the collocation likelihood. In this paper, we use the skip-gram formulation (Mikolov et al., 2013b), because it is more light-weight and thus requires less training time: only two sense selections are required for stochastic training, while GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) and continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) (Mikolov et al., 2013a) require the whole corpus and the whole context window for sense selection respectively.\nSpecifically, we first create input sense embedding matrixU and collocation estimation matrix V as the representations to be learned. Given a word wi and collocated word wj with corresponding local contexts, we map them to their sense identities as zik and zjl by the sense selection module, and maximize the sense collocation log likelihood logCo(·) using a negative sampling approximation (Mikolov et al., 2013b),\nlogCo(zik, zjl | U, V ) = log σ(UTzikVzjl) (1)\n+ M∑ v=1 Ezuv∼pneg(z)[log σ(−U T zik Vzuv)],\nwhere pneg(z) is the distribution over all senses for negative samples."

In order to estimate the sense collocation likelihood, two senses, zik and zjl, should be determined, which leads a two-step MDP: one for the target word wi and the other for the collocated word wj within a context window. A policy gradient algorithm (Sutton et al., 1999) can formulate the policies as decision probability distributions πiθ(zik|C̄t) and π j θ(zjl|C̄t′) for words wi, wj given their contexts C̄t, C̄t′ . Hence, a joint formulation can be written as follows,\nmax U,V,θ Ek∼πiθ(·)[El∼πjθ(·)[logCo(zik, zjl | U, V )]]. (2) The neat formulation is differentiable and supports stochastic optimization using doubly stochastic gradient (Lei et al., 2016). However, there are two major drawbacks of this formulation. First, it requires a policy πθ to fit a valid probability distribution, and this constraint underestimates the probability of senses that have not been selected yet during optimization. Second, if using stochastic gradient ascent (detailed in Appendix A) to optimize equation (2), it would actually lower the probability estimation for the selected sense because logCo(·) ≤ 0, which is not desirable if the model accurately select the right sense."

Also, considering that the Qlearning algorithm is not constrained by a jointprobabilistic formulation, we reduce the range of the reward function to facilitate the training process by replacing the collocation log likelihood logCo ∈ (− inf, 0] with (its monotonous) likelihood Co ∈ [0, 1] as the reward function (Mnih et al., 2013).\nOur model utilizes a CBOW architecture to model the fitness for a sense zik of a wordwi under a local context C̄t.

Therefore, the prediction layer is initialized to 0 so that all Qvalues remain σ(0) = 0.5 until having been selected due to independent updates in Q-learning.

Specifically, given a list of word pairs with corresponding contexts, S = {(wi, C̄t, wj , C̄t′)}, we calculate the Spearman’s rank correlation ρ between human-judged similarity and model similarity estimations. Two major contextual similarity estimations are introduced by Reisinger and Mooney (2010): AvgSimC and MaxSimC (also referred to LocalSim in Neelakantan et al. (2014)).

The reason is that, any sense selection model seeks a function f(zik | C̄t) to evaluate the fitness of each sense zik under a context C̄t, such as the cluster similarity in clustering methods, the likelihood or vanilla probability estimation in probabilistic models, and the Q-value in our model. Hence, to achieve the optimal expected fitness E[f(zik | C̄t)], the optimal probability assignment on senses is only selecting one and the optimal sense:\npopt(zik | C̄t) = { 1 if k = arg maxk′ f(zik′ |C̄t), 0 otherwise.\nNote that the above probability assignment makes AvgSimC=MaxSimC. Because the expected fitness E[f(zik | C̄t)] over any probability distribution would be no greater than the fitness value over the above distribution, the similar phenomenon (MaxSimC≥AvgSimC) can be observed in the robust fitness estimation (cluster similarity/likelihood/Q-value).

To derive doubly stochastic gradient for equation (2), we first resolve the expectation form as:\nJ(U, V, θ)\n= Ek∼πiθ(·)[El∼πjθ(·)[L(·)]] = ∑ k ∑ l πiθ(zik|C̄t)π j θ(zjl|C̄t′)L(·).\nThe gradient of J with respect to Θ should be:\n∂J(U, V, θ)\n∂Θ\n= ∂\n∂Θ ∑ k ∑ l πiθ(zik|C̄t)π j θ(zjl|C̄t′)L(·)\n= ∑ k ∑ l πiθ(zik|C̄t)L(·) ∂πjθ(zjl|C̄t′) ∂Θ\n+ ∑ k ∑ l πjθ(zjl|C̄t′)L(·) ∂πiθ(zik|C̄t) ∂Θ\n= Ek∼πiθ(·)[ ∑ l L(·) ∂ log πjθ(zjl|C̄t′) ∂Θ πjθ(zjl|C̄t′)]\n+ E l∼πjθ(·) [ ∑ k L(·) ∂ log πiθ(zik|C̄t) ∂Θ πiθ(zik|C̄t)]\n= Ek∼πiθ(·)[El∼πjθ(·)[L(·) ∂\n∂Θ (log πiθ(zik|C̄t) + log π j θ(zjl|C̄t′))]]\nAccordingly, if we conduct typical stochastic gradient ascent training on J(U, V,Θ) with respect to Θ from samples k and l with a learning rate η, the update formula will be:\n∆Θ = ηL(·) ∂ ∂Θ (log πiθ(zik|C̄t) + log π j θ(zjl|C̄t′)).\nHowever, because the collocation likelihood is a valid probability distribution, the collocation log likelihood should always be non-positive: L(·) = logCo(zik, zjl|U, V ) ≤ 0. Therefore, as long as the collocation log likelihood L is negative, the update formula is to minimize the likelihood of choosing l and k, despite the fact that l and k may be good choices. On the other hand, if the log likelihood reaches 0, it also indicates that the likelihood reaches infinity and computational overflow on U and V ."

      "text" : "In this section, we conduct ablation experiments by removing each components separately in our system to test the efficacy of proposed mechanisms. Specifically, we test the following components:\n• Non-parametric: To remove the nonparametric learning mechanism in our model, we initialize the prediction layer Q in the sense selection module from uniform distribution [− √ 1/100, √ 1/100] as the\nword embedding P .\n• Sense exploration: To remove the word sense exploration mechanism in our model, we turn off the dropout mechanism during training.\n• Sense selection prior: To remove the sense selection prior mechanism in our model, we remove the target word wi in the input of the sense selection module as C̄t = {Ct−m, ..., Ct−1, Ct+1, ..., Ct+m}.\nIn addition, we also test the efficacy of specific module according to their complexity. We test the setting when the embedding dimension in the sense selection module is set to 50 (50D/300D), and the embedding dimensions in the both modules are set to 50 (50D/50D).\nThe experiment results are shown in Table 4. Consistent improvement in terms of MaxSimC from each component to the proposed DRL-Sense model can be observed. In addition, the improvement from increasing the complexity (embedding dimension) demonstrate the efficacy of both modules (50D-50D→50D-300D and 50D300D→DRL-Sense)."
