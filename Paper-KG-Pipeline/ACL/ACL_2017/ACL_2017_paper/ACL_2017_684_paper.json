      "text" : "A recent trend to measure progress towards machine reading is to test a system’s ability to answer questions about a document it has to comprehend. Towards this end, several large-scale datasets of cloze-style questions over a context document have been introduced recently, which allow the training of supervised machine learning systems (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015; Onishi et al., 2016). Such datasets can be easily constructed automatically and the unambiguous nature of their queries provides an objective benchmark to measure a system’s performance at text comprehension.\nDeep learning models have been shown to outperform traditional shallow approaches on text comprehension tasks (Hermann et al., 2015). The\nsuccess of many recent models can be attributed primarily to two factors: (1) Multi-hop architectures allow a (Weston et al., 2014; Sordoni et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016), model to scan the document and the question iteratively for multiple passes. (2) Attention mechanisms, (Chen et al., 2016; Hermann et al., 2015) borrowed from the machine translation literature (Bahdanau et al., 2014), allow the model to focus on appropriate subparts of the context document. Intuitively, the multi-hop architecture allows the reader to incrementally refine token representations, and the attention mechanism re-weights different parts in the document according to their relevance to the query.\nThe effectiveness of multi-hop reasoning and attentions have been explored orthogonally so far in the literature. In this paper, we focus on combining both in a complementary manner, by designing a novel attention mechanism which gates the evolving token representations across hops. More specifically, unlike existing models where the query attention is applied either token-wise (Hermann et al., 2015; Kadlec et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2015) or sentence-wise (Weston et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) to allow weighted aggregation, the Gated-Attention (GA) module proposed in this work allows the query to directly interact with each dimension of the token embeddings at the semantic-level, and is applied layer-wise as information filters during the multi-hop representation learning process. Such a fine-grained attention enables our model to learn conditional token representations w.r.t. the given question, leading to accurate answer selections.\nWe show in our experiments that the proposed GA reader, despite its relative simplicity, consistently improves over a variety of strong baselines on three benchmark datasets Our key contribution, the GA module, provides a significant im-\n2 ACL 2017 Submission ***.

Qualitatively, visualization of the attentions at intermediate layers of the GA reader shows that in each layer the GA reader attends to distinct salient aspects of the query which help in determining the answer."

      "text" : "The cloze-style QA task involves tuples of the form (d, q, a, C), where d is a document (context), q is a query over the contents of d, in which a phrase is replaced with a placeholder, and a is the answer to q, which comes from a set of candidates C. In this work we consider datasets where each candidate c ∈ C has at least one token which also appears in the document. The task can then be described as: given a document-query pair (d, q), find a ∈ C which answers q. Below we provide an overview of representative neural network architectures which have been applied to this problem. LSTMs with Attention: Several architectures introduced in (Hermann et al., 2015) employ LSTM units to compute a combined document-query representation g(d, q), which is used to rank the candidate answers. These include the DeepLSTM Reader which performs a single forward pass through the concatenated (document, query) pair to obtain g(d, q); the Attentive Reader which first computes a document vector d(q) by a weighted aggregation of words according to attentions based on q, and then combines d(q) and q to obtain their joint representation g(d(q), q); and the Impatient Reader where the document representation is built incrementally. The architecture of the Attentive Reader has been simplified recently in Stanford Attentive Reader, where shallower recurrent units were used with a bilinear form for the query-document attention (Chen et al., 2016). Attention Sum: The Attention-Sum (AS) Reader (Kadlec et al., 2016) uses two bidirectional GRU networks (Cho et al., 2014) to encode both d and q into vectors. A probability distribution over the entities in d is obtained by computing dot products between q and the entity embeddings and taking a softmax. Then, an aggregation scheme named pointer-sum attention is further applied to sum the probabilities of the same entity, so that frequent entities the document will be favored compared to rare ones. Building on the AS Reader, the Attention-over-Attention (AoA) Reader (Cui et al., 2016) introduces a two-way attention mechanism where the query and the document are mutually attentive to each other. Mulit-hop Architectures: Memory Networks (MemNets) were proposed in (Weston et al., 2014), where each sentence in the document is encoded to a memory by aggregating nearby words. Attention over the memory slots given the query is used to compute an overall memory and to renew the query representation over multiple iterations, allowing certain types of reasoning over the salient facts in the memory and the query. Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE) (Munkhdalai & Yu, 2016a) extended MemNets by introducing a write operation which can evolve the memory over time during the course of reading. Iterative reasoning has been found effective in several more recent models, including the Iterative Attentive Reader (Sordoni et al., 2016) and ReasoNet (Shen et al., 2016). The latter allows dynamic reasoning steps and is trained with reinforcement learning. Other related works include Dynamic Entity Representation network (DER) (Kobayashi et al., 2016), which builds dynamic representations of the candidate answers while reading the document, and accumulates the information about an entity by max-pooling; EpiReader (Trischler et al., 2016) consists of two networks, where one proposes a small set of candidate answers, and the other reranks the proposed candidates conditioned on the query and the context; Bi-Directional Attention Flow network (BiDAF) (Seo et al., 2016) adopts a multi-stage hierarchical architecture along with a flow-based attention mechanism; (Bajgar et al., 2016) showed a 10% improvement on the CBT corpus (Hill et al., 2015) by training the AS Reader on an augmented training set of about 14 million examples, making a case for the community to exploit data abundance. The focus of this paper, however, is on designing models which exploit the available data efficiently."

      "text" : "Our proposed GA readers perform multiple hops over the document (context), similar to the Memory Networks architecture (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). Multi-hop architectures mimic the multistep comprehension process of human readers, and have shown promising results in several recent models for text comprehension (Sordoni et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2016). The contextual representations in GA readers, namely the embeddings of words in the document, are it-\n3 ACL 2017 Submission ***. Confidential Review Copy. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE. eratively refined across hops until reaching a final attention-sum module (Kadlec et al., 2016) which maps the contextual representations in the last hop to a probability distribution over candidate answers. The attention mechanism has been introduced recently to model human focus, leading to significant improvement in machine translation and image captioning (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Mnih et al., 2014). In reading comprehension tasks, ideally, the semantic meanings carried by the contextual embeddings should be aware of the query across hops. As an example, human readers are able to keep the question in mind during multiple passes of reading, to successively mask away information irrelevant to the query. However, existing neural network readers are restricted to either attend to tokens (Hermann et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016) or entire sentences (Weston et al., 2014), with the assumption that certain sub-parts of the document are more important than others. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained model which attends to components of the semantic representation being built up by the GRU. The new attention mechanism, called gated-attention, is implemented via multiplicative interactions between the query and the contextual embeddings, and is applied per hop to act as fine-grained information filters during the multi-step reasoning. The filters weigh individual components of the vector representation of each token in the document separately. The design of gated-attention layers is motivated by the effectiveness of multiplicative interaction among vector-space representations, e.g., in various types of recurrent units (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Wu et al., 2016) and in relational learning (Yang et al., 2014; Kiros et al., 2014). While other types of compositional operators are possible, such as concatenation or addition (Mitchell & Lapata, 2008), we find that multiplication has strong empirical performance (section 4.3), where query representations naturally serve as information filters across hops."

      "text" : "We evaluate the GA reader on five large-scale datasets recently proposed in the literature. The first two, CNN and Daily Mail news stories1 consist of articles from the popular CNN and Daily Mail websites (Hermann et al., 2015). A query over each article is formed by removing an entity from the short summary which follows the article. Further, entities within each article were anonymized to make the task purely a comprehension one. N-gram statistics, for instance, computed over the entire corpus are no longer useful in such an anonymized corpus. The next two datasets are formed from two different subsets of the Children’s Book Test (CBT)2 (Hill et al., 2015). Documents consist of 20 contiguous sentences from the body of a popular children’s book, and queries are formed by deleting a token from the 21st sentence. We only focus on subsets where the deleted token is either a common noun (CN) or named entity (NE) since simple language models already give human-level performance on the other types (cf. (Hill et al., 2015)). The final dataset is Who Did What3 (WDW) (Onishi et al., 2016), constructed from the LDC 1 https://github.com/deepmind/rc-data 2 http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/babi/ CBTest.tgz 3 https://tticnlp.github.io/who_did_what/ English Gigaword newswire corpus. First, article pairs which appeared around the same time and with overlapping entities are chosen, and then one article forms the document and a cloze query is constructed from the other. Missing tokens are always person named entities. Questions which are easily answered by simple baselines are filtered out, to make the task more challenging. There are two versions of the training set—a small but focused “Strict” version and a large but noisy “Relaxed” version. We report results on both settings which share the same validation and test sets. Statistics of all the datasets used in our experiments are summarized in the Appendix (Table 4)."

The numbers reported for GA Reader are for single best models, though we compare to both ensembles and single models from prior work. GA Reader-- refers to an earlier version of the model, unpublished but described in a preprint, with the following differences—(1) it does not utilize token-specific attentions within the GA module, as described in equation (5), (2) it does not use a character composition model, (3) it is initialized with word embeddings pretrained on the corpus itself rather than GloVe. A detailed analysis of these differences is studied in the next section. Here we present 4 variants of the latest GA Reader, using combinations of whether the qe-comm feature is used (+feature) or not, and whether the word lookup table L(w) is updated during training or fixed to its initial value. Other hyperparameters are listed in Appendix A. Interestingly, we observe that feature engineering leads to significant improvements for WDW and CBT datasets, but not for CNN and Daily Mail datasets. We note that anonymization of the latter datasets means that there is already some feature engineering (it adds hints about whether a token is an entity), and these are much larger than the other four. In machine learning it is common to see the effect of feature engineering diminish with increasing data size. Similarly, fixing the word embeddings provides an improvement for the WDW and CBT, but not for CNN and Daily Mail. This is not surprising given that the latter datasets are larger and less prone to overfitting.\n6\nACL 2017 Submission ***. Confidential Review Copy.

      "text" : "In this section we do an ablation study to see the effect of Gated Attention. We compare the GA Reader as described here to a model which is exactly the same in all aspects, except that it passes document embeddings D(k) in each layer directly to the inputs of the next layer without using the GA module. In other words X(k) = D(k) for all k > 0. This model ends up using only one query GRU at the output layer for selecting the answer from the document. We compare these two variants both with and without the qe-comm feature on CNN and WDW datasets for three subsets of the training data - 50%, 75% and 100%. Test set accuracies for these settings are shown in Figure 2. On CNN when tested without feature engineering, we observe that GA provides a significant boost in performance compared to without GA. When tested with the feature it still gives an improvement, but the improvement is significant only with 100% training data. On WDW-Strict, which is a third of the size of CNN, without the feature we see an improvement when using GA versus without using GA, which becomes significant as the training set size increases. When tested with the feature on WDW, for a small data size without GA does better than with GA, but as the dataset size increases they become equivalent. We conclude that GA provides a boost in the absence of feature engineering, or as the training set size increases. Next we look at the question of how to gate intermediate document reader states from the query, i.e. what operation to use in equation 6. Table 2 (top) shows the performance on WDW dataset for three common choices – sum (x = d + q), concatenate (x = d‖q) and multiply (x = d q). Empirically we find element-wise multiplication does significantly better than the other two, which justifies our motivation to “filter” out document features which are irrelevant to the query. At the bottom of Table 2 we show the effect of varying the number of hops K of the GA Reader on the final performance. We note that for K = 1, our model is equivalent to the AS Reader without any GA modules.

Note that the strongest baseline on WDW, NSE (Munkhdalai & Yu, 2016b), also uses pretrained GloVe vectors, hence the comparison is fair in that respect. Next, we observe a substantial drop when removing token-specific attentions over the query in the GA module, which allow gating individual tokens in the document only by parts of the query relevant to that token rather than the overall query representation. Finally, removing the character embeddings, which were only used for WDW and CBT, leads to a reduction of about 1% in the performance.\nC Attention Plots\nACL 2017 Submission ***.

Our model, the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, integrates a multi-hop architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based on multiplicative interactions between the query embedding and the intermediate states of a recurrent neural network document reader. This enables the reader to build query-specific representations of tokens in the document for accurate answer selection. The GA Reader obtains state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks for this task–the CNN & Daily Mail news stories and the Who Did What dataset. The effectiveness of multiplicative interaction is demonstrated by an ablation study, and by comparing to alternative compositional operators for implementing the gated-attention.",
