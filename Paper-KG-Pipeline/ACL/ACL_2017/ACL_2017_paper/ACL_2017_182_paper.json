      "text" : "Emotion recognition and sentiment analysis have become a new trend in social media, helping users to automatically extract the opinions expressed in user-generated content, especially videos. Thanks to the high availability of computers and smartphones, and the rapid rise of social media, consumers tend to record their reviews and opinions about products or films and upload them on social media platforms, such as YouTube or Facebook. Such videos often contain comparisons, which can aid prospective buyers make an informed decision.\nThe primary advantage of analyzing videos over text is the surplus of behavioral cues present in vocal and visual modalities. The vocal modulations and facial expressions in the visual data, along with textual data, provide important cues to better identify affective states of the opinion holder. Thus, a combination of text and video data helps to create a better emotion and sentiment analysis model (Poria et al., 2017).\nRecently, a number of approaches to multimodal sentiment analysis, producing interesting results, have been proposed (Pérez-Rosas et al., 2013; Wollmer et al., 2013; Poria et al., 2015). However, there are major issues that remain unaddressed, such as the role of speaker-dependent versus speaker-independent models, the impact of each modality across the dataset, and generalization ability of a multimodal sentiment classifier. Leaving these issues unaddressed has presented difficulties in effective comparison of different multimodal sentiment analysis methods.\nAn utterance is a unit of speech bound by breathes or pauses. Utterance-level sentiment analysis focuses on tagging every utterance of a video with a sentiment label (instead of assigning a unique label to the whole video). In particular, utterance-level sentiment analysis is useful to understand the sentiment dynamics of different aspects of the topics covered by the speaker throughout his/her speech. The true meaning of an utterance is relative to its surrounding utterances.\nIn this paper, we consider such surrounding utterances to be the context, as the consideration of temporal relation and dependency among utterances is key in human-human communication. For example, the MOSI dataset (Zadeh et al., 2016) contains a video, in which a girl reviews the movie ‘Green Hornet’. At one point, she says “The Green Hornet did something similar”. Normally, doing something similar, i.e., monotonous or repetitive might be perceived as negative. However, the nearby utterances “It engages the audience more”, “they took a new spin on it”, “and I just loved it” indicate a positive context.\nIn this paper, we discard the oversimplifying hypothesis on the independence of utterances and develop a framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract utterance features that also consider surrounding utterances.\nOur model enables consecutive utterances to share information, thus providing contextual information in the classification process. Experimental results show that the proposed framework has outperformed the state of the art on benchmark datasets by 5−10%. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief literature review on multimodal sentiment analysis; Section 3 describes the proposed method in detail; experimental results and discussion are shown in Section 4; finally, Section 5 concludes the paper."

      "text" : "Text-based sentiment analysis systems can be broadly categorized into knowledge-based and statistics-based systems (Cambria, 2016). While the use of knowledge bases was initially more popular for the identification of emotions and polarity in text, sentiment analysis researchers have recently been using statistics-based approaches, with a special focus on supervised statistical methods (Pang et al., 2002; Socher et al., 2013).\nIn 1970, Ekman (Ekman, 1974) carried out extensive studies on facial expressions which showed that universal facial expressions are able to provide sufficient clues to detect emotions. Recent studies on speech-based emotion analysis (Datcu and Rothkrantz, 2008) have focused on identifying relevant acoustic features, such as fundamental frequency (pitch), intensity of utterance, bandwidth, and duration.\nAs for fusing audio and visual modalities for emotion recognition, two of the early works were done by De Silva et al. (De Silva et al., 1997) and Chen et al. (Chen et al., 1998). Both works showed that a bimodal system yielded a higher accuracy than any unimodal system. More recent research on audio-visual fusion for emotion recognition has been conducted at either feature level (Kessous et al., 2010) or decision level (Schuller, 2011).\nWhile there are many research papers on audiovisual fusion for emotion recognition, only a few have been devoted to multimodal emotion or sentiment analysis using textual clues along with visual and audio modalities. Wollmer et al. (Wollmer et al., 2013) and Rozgic et al. (Rozgic et al., 2012a,b) fused information from audio, visual, and textual modalities to extract emotion and sentiment. Metallinou et al. (Metallinou et al., 2008) and Eyben et al. (Eyben et al., 2010a) fused audio and textual modalities for emotion recognition.\nBoth approaches relied on a feature-level fusion. Wu et al. (Wu and Liang, 2011) fused audio and textual clues at decision level."

Below, we propose an overview of the method -\n1. Context-Independent Unimodal UtteranceLevel Feature Extraction\nFirst, the unimodal features are extracted without considering the contextual information of the utterances (Section 3.1). Table 1 presents the feature extraction methods used for each modality.\n2. Contextual Unimodal and Multimodal Classification\nThe context-independent unimodal features (from Step 1) are then fed into a LSTM network (termed contextual LSTM) that allows consecutive utterances in a video to share semantic information in the feature extraction process (which provides context-dependent unimodal and multimodal classification of the utterances). We experimentally show that this proposed framework improves the performance of utterance-level sentiment classification over traditional frameworks.\nVideos, comprising of its constituent utterances, serve as the input. We represent the dataset as U:\nU = ⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ u1,1 u1,2 u1,3 ... u1,L1 u2,1 u2,2 u2,3 ... u2,L2 . . . ... . uM,1 uM,2 uM,3 ... uM,LM ⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ .\nHere, ui,j denotes the jth utterance of the ith video and L = [L1, L2, ..., LM ] represents the number of utterances per video in the dataset set."

      "text" : "For feature extraction from textual data, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN).\nThe idea behind convolution is to take the dot product of a vector of k weights, wk, known as kernel vector, with each k-gram in the sentence s(t) to obtain another sequence of features c(t) = (c1(t), c2(t), . . . , cL(t)):\ncj = wTk ⋅ xi∶i+k−1. We then apply a max pooling operation over the feature map and take the maximum value ĉ(t) = max{c(t)} as the feature corresponding to this particular kernel vector. We use varying kernel vectors and window sizes to obtain multiple features.\nThe process of extracting textual features is as follows -\nFirst, we represent each sentence as the concatenation of vectors of the constituent words. These vectors are the publicly available -dimensional word2vec vectors trained on 100 billion words from Google News (Mikolov et al., 2013). The convolution kernels are thus applied to these word vectors instead of individual words. Each sentence is wrapped to a window of 50 words which serves as the input to the CNN.\nThe CNN has two convolutional layers - the first layer having a kernel size of 3 and 4, with 50 feature maps each and a kernel size 2 with 100 feature maps for the second. The convolution layers are interleaved with pooling layers of dimension 2. We use ReLU as the activation function. The convolution of the CNN over the sentence learns abstract representations of the phrases equipped with implicit semantic information, which with each successive layer spans over increasing number of words and ultimately the entire sentence."

Voice normalization is performed and voice intensity is thresholded to identify samples with and without voice. Z-standardization is used to perform voice normalization.\nThe features extracted by openSMILE consist of several low-level descriptors (LLD) and their statistical functionals.

We hypothesize that 3D-CNN will not only be able to learn relevant features from each frame, but will also be able to learn the changes among given number of consecutive frames.\nIn the past, 3D-CNN has been successfully applied to object classification on 3D data (Ji et al., 2013). Its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results motivated us to use it.\nLet vid ∈ Rc×f×h×w be a video, where c = number of channels in an image (in our case c = 3, since we consider only RGB images), f = number of frames, h = height of the frames, and w = width of the frames. Again, we consider the 3D convolutional filter filt ∈ Rfm×c×fl×fh×fw, where fm = number of feature maps, c = number of channels, fd = number of frames (in other words depth of the filter), fh = height of the filter, and fw = width of the filter. Similar to 2D-CNN, filt slides across video vid and generates output convout ∈ Rfm×c×(f−fd+1)×(h−fh+1)×(w−fw+1). Next, we apply max pooling to convout to select only relevant features. The pooling will be applied only to the last three dimensions of the array convout.\nIn our experiments, we obtained best results with 32 feature maps (fm) with the filter-size of 5 × 5 × 5 (or fd × fh × fw). In other words, the dimension of the filter is 32 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 (or fm × c × fd × fh × fw). Subsequently, we apply max pooling on the output of convolution operation, with window-size being 3×3×3. This is followed by a dense layer of size 300 and softmax. The activations of this dense layer are finally used as the video features for each utterance."

Since most videos tend to be about a single topic, the utterances within each video are correlated, e.g., due to the development of the speaker’s idea, coreferences, etc. This calls for a model which takes into account such inter-dependencies and the effect these might have on the current utterance. To capture this flow of informational triggers across utterances, we use a LSTM-based recurrent network scheme (Gers, 2001)."

Current research (Zhou et al., 2016) indicates the benefit of using such networks to incorporate contextual information in the classification process.\nIn our case, the LSTM network serves the purpose of context-dependent feature extraction by modeling relations among utterances.

As the videos do not have same the number of utterances, padding is introduced to serve as neutral utterances. To avoid the proliferation of noise within the network, masking is done on these padded utterances to eliminate their effect in the network. Parameter tuning is done on the train set by splitting it into train and validation components with 80/20% split. RMSprop has been used as the optimizer which is known to resolve Adagrad’s radically diminishing learning rates (Duchi et al., 2011). After feeding the train set to the network, the test set is passed through it to generate their context-dependent features.\nDifferent Network Architectures We consider the following variants of the contextual LSTM architecture in our experiments -\nsc-LSTM This variant of the contextual LSTM architecture consists of unidirectional\nLSTM cells. As this is the simple variant of the contextual LSTM, we termed it as simple contextual LSTM (sc-LSTM)\nh-LSTM We also test on an architecture where the dense layer after the LSTM cell is omitted. Thus, the output of the LSTM cell hi,t provides our context-dependent features and the softmax layer provides the classification. We call this architecture hidden LSTM (h-LSTM).\nbc-LSTM Bi-directional LSTMs are two unidirectional LSTMs stacked together having opposite directions. Thus, an utterance can get information from other utterances occurring before and after itself in the video. We replaced the regular LSTM with a bi-directional LSTM and named the resulting architecture as bi-directional contextual LSTM (bc-LSTM). The training process of this architecture is similar to sc-LSTM.\nuni-SVM In this setting, we first obtain the unimodal features as explained in Section 3.1, concatenate them and then send to a SVM for the final classification. It should be noted that using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) instead of LSTM did not improve the performance."

Our train/test splits of the datasets are completely disjoint with respect to speakers.\nWhile testing, our models have to classify emotions and sentiments from utterances by speakers they have never seen before.\nIEMOCAP: The IEMOCAP contains the acts of 10 speakers in a two way conversation segmented into utterances. The database contains the following categorical labels: anger, happiness, sadness, neutral, excitement, frustration, fear, surprise, and other, but we take only the first four so as to compare with the state of the art (Rozgic et al., 2012b) and other authors.

It contains positive and negative classes as its sentiment labels. The train/validation set comprises of the first 62 individuals in the dataset.\nMOUD: This dataset contains product review videos provided by around 55 persons. The reviews are in Spanish (we use Google Translate API1 to get the english transcripts). The utterances are labeled to be either positive, negative or neutral. However, we drop the neutral label to maintain consistency with previous work. The first 59 videos are considered in the train/val set.\nTable 3 provides information regarding train/test split of all the datasets. In these splits it is ensured that 1) No two utterances from the train and test splits belong to the same video. 2) The train/test splits have no speaker overlap. This provides the speaker-independent setting.\nTable 3 also provides cross dataset split details where the complete datasets of MOSI and MOUD are used for training and testing respectively. The proposed model being used on reviews from different languages allows us to analyze its robustness and generalizability.\nIt should be noted that the datasets’ individual configuration and splits are same throughout all the experiments (i.e., context-independent unimodal feature extraction, LSTM-based context-\n1http://translate.google.com\ndependent unimodal and multimodal feature extraction and classification)."

Table 4 demonstrates this by comparing both hierarchical and non-hierarchical framework using the bc-LSTM network. Due to this fact, we provide all further analysis and results using the hierarchical framework. Nonhierarchical model outperforms the performance of the baseline uni-SVM. This further leads us to conclude that it is the context-sensitive learning paradigm which plays the key role in improving performance over the baseline.\nComparison among Network Variants - It is to be noted that both sc-LSTM and bc-LSTM perform quite well on the multimodal emotion recognition and sentiment analysis datasets. Since, bcLSTM has access to both the preceding and following information of the utterance sequence, it performs consistently better on all the datasets over sc-LSTM.\nThe usefulness of the dense layer in improving the performance is prominent from the experimental results as shown in Table 4. The performance improvement is in the range of 0.3% to 1.5% on MOSI and MOUD datasets. On the IEMOCAP dataset, the performance improvement of bc-LSTM and sc-LSTM over h-LSTM is in the range of 1% to 5%.\nComparison with the Baseline and state of the art - Every LSTM network variant has outperformed the baseline uni-SVM on all the datasets by the margin of 2% to 5%(see Table 4). These results prove our initial hypothesis that modeling the contextual dependencies among utterances, which uni-SVM cannot do, improves the classification. The higher performance improvement on the IEMOCAP dataset indicates the necessity of modeling long-range dependencies among the utterances as continuous emotion recognition\nis a multiclass sequential problem where a person doesnt frequently change emotions (Wöllmer et al., 2008).\nWe have implemented and compared with the current state-of-the-art approach proposed by Poria et al. (Poria et al., 2015). In their method, they extracted features from each modality and fed to a multiple kernel learning (MKL) classifier. However, they did not conduct the experiment in speaker-independent manner and also did not consider the contextual relation among the utterances. Experimental results in Table 5 shows that the proposed method has outperformed Poria et al. (Poria et al., 2015) by a significant margin. For the emotion recognition task, we have compared our method with the current state of the art (Rozgic et al., 2012b), who extracted features in a similar fashion to (Poria et al., 2015) did.

In order to have a better understanding on roles of modalities for overall classification, we also have done some qualitative analysis. For example, this utterance - ”who doesn’t have any presence or greatness at all.”, was classified as positive by the audio classifier (“doesn’t” was spoken normally by the speaker, but “presence and greatness at all” was spoken with enthusiasm). However, textual modality caught the negation induced by “doesn’t” and classified correctly. In another utterance “amazing special effects” as there was no jest of enthusiasm in speaker’s voice and face audio-visual classifier failed to identify the positivity of this utterance. On the other textual classifier correctly detected the polarity as positive.\nOn the other hand, textual classifier classified this sentence - “that like to see comic book characters treated responsibly” as positive, possibly because of the presence of positive phrases such as “like to see”, “responsibly”. However, the high pitch of anger in the person’s voice and the frowning face helps identify this to be a negative utterance."
