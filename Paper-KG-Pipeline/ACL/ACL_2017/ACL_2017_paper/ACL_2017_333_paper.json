      "text" : "Sentence summarization aims to shorten a given sentence and produce a brief summary of it. This is different from document level summarization task since it is hard to apply existing techniques in extractive methods, such as extracting sentence level features and ranking sentences. Early works propose using rule-based methods (Zajic et al., 2007), syntactic tree pruning methods (Knight and Marcu, 2002), statistical machine translation techniques (Banko et al., 2000) and so on for this task. We focus on abstractive sentence summarization task in this paper.\nRecently, neural network models have been applied in this task. Rush et al. (2015) use autoconstructed sentence-headline pairs to train a neural network summarization model. They use a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and feed-forward neural network language model decoder for this task. Chopra et al. (2016) extend their work by replacing the decoder with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Nallapati et al. (2016) follow this line and change the encoder to RNN to make it a full RNN based sequence-tosequence model (Sutskever et al., 2014).\nAll the above works fall into the encodingdecoding paradigm, which first encodes the input sentence to an abstract representation and then decodes the intended output sentence based on the encoded information. As an extension of the encoding-decoding framework, attentionbased approach (Bahdanau et al., 2015) has been broadly used: the encoder produces a list of vectors for all tokens in the input, and the decoder uses an attention mechanism to dynamically extract encoded information and align with the output tokens. This approach achieves huge success in tasks like neural machine translation, where alignment between all parts of the input and output are required. However, in abstractive sentence summarization, there is no explicit alignment relationship between input sentence and the summary except for the extracted common words. The\nchallenge here is not to infer the alignment, but to select the highlights while filtering out secondary information in the input. A desired work-flow for abstractive sentence summarization is encoding, selection, and decoding. After selecting the important information from an encoded sentence, the decoder produces the output summary using the selected information. For example, in Figure 1, given the input sentence, the summarization system first selects the important information, and then rephrases or paraphrases to produce a well-organized summary. Although this is implicitly modeled in the encoding-decoding framework, we argue that abstractive sentence summarization shall benefit from explicitly modeling this selection process.\nIn this paper we propose Selective Encoding for Abstractive Sentence Summarization (SEASS). We treat the sentence summarization as a threephase task: encoding, selection, and decoding. It consists of a sentence encoder, a selective gate network, and a summary decoder. First, the sentence encoder reads the input words through an RNN unit to construct the first level sentence representation. Then the selective gate network selects the encoded information to construct the second level sentence representation. The selective mechanism controls the information flow from encoder to decoder by applying a gate network according to the sentence information, which helps improve encoding effectiveness and release the burden of the decoder. Finally, the attention-equipped decoder generates the summary using the second level sentence representation. We conduct experiments on English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and Microsoft Research Abstractive Text Compression test sets. Our SEASS model achieves 17.54 ROUGE-2 F1, 9.56 ROUGE-2 recall and 10.63 ROUGE-2 F1 on these test sets respectively, which improves performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

If |y| * |x|,\nwhich means not all words in summary come from input sentence, we denote this as abstractive sentence summarization. Table 1 provides an example. We focus on abstracive sentence summarization task in this paper."

First, the bidirectional GRU encoder reads the input words x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) and builds its representation (h1, h2, . . . , hn). Then the selective gate selects and filters the word representations according to the sentence meaning representation to produce a tailored sentence word representation for abstractive sentence summarization task. Lastly, the GRU decoder produces the output summary with attention to the tailored representation. In the following sections, we introduce the sentence encoder, the selective mechanism, and the summary decoder respectively."

Here we employ a bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) as the recurrent unit, where GRU is defined as:\nzi = σ(Wz[xi, hi−1]) ri = σ(Wr[xi, hi−1])\nh̃i = tanh(Wh[xi, ri hi−1])\nhi = (1− zi) hi−1 + zi h̃i\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nThe BiGRU consists of a forward GRU and a backward GRU. The forward GRU reads the input sentence word embeddings from left to right and gets a sequence of hidden states, (~h1,~h2, . . . ,~hn). The backward GRU reads the input sentence\nembeddings reversely, from right to left, and results in another sequence of hidden states, ( ~h1, ~h2, . . . , ~hn):\n~hi = GRU(xi,~hi−1) ~hi = GRU(xi, ~hi+1)\n(5)\n(6)\nThe initial states of the BiGRU are set to zero vectors, i.e., ~h1 = 0 and ~hn = 0. After reading the sentence, the forward and backward hidden states are concatenated, i.e., hi = [~hi; ~hi], to get the basic sentence representation."

      "heading" : "3.2 Selective Mechanism",
      "text" : "In the sequence-to-sequence machine translation (MT) model, the encoder and decoder are responsible for encoding input sentence information and decoding the sentence representation to generate an output sentence. Some previous works apply this framework to summarization generation tasks. However, abstractive sentence summarization is different from MT in two ways. First, there is no explicit alignment relationship between the input sentence and the output summary except for the common words. Second, summarization task needs to keep the highlights and remove the unnecessary information, while MT needs to keep all information literally.\nHerein, we propose a selective mechanism to model the selection process for abstractive sentence summarization. The selective mechanism extends the sequence-to-sequence model by constructing a tailored representation for abstractive sentence summarization task. Concretely, the selective gate network in our model takes two vector\ninputs, the sentence word vector hi and the sentence representation vector s. The sentence word vector hi is the output of the BiGRU encoder and represents the meaning and context information of word xi. The sentence vector s is used to represent the meaning of the sentence. For each word xi, the selective gate network generates a gate vector sGatei using hi and s, then the tailored representation is constructed, i.e., h′i.\nIn detail, we concatenate the last forward hidden state ~hn and backward hidden state ~h1 as the sentence representation s:\ns =\n[ ~h1\n~hn\n] (7)\nFor each time step i, the select gate takes the sentence representation s and BiGRU hidden hi as inputs to compute the select gate sGatei:\nsGatei = σ(Wshi +Uss+ b) h′i = hi sGatei (8) (9)\nwhere σ is sigmoid activation function and is element-wise multiplication. After the selective gate network, we obtain another sequence of vectors (h′1, h ′ 2, . . . , h ′ n). This new sequence is then used as the input sentence representation for the decoder to generate the summary."

To initialize the GRU hidden state, we use a linear layer with the last backward encoder hidden state ~h1 as input:\nst = GRU(wt−1, ct−1, st−1)\ns0 = tanh(Wd ~h1 + b)\n(10)\n(11)\nThe context vector ct for current time step t is computed through the concatenate attention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015), which matches the current decoder state st with each encoder hidden state h′i to get an importance score.

The parallel corpus is produced by pairing the first sentence and the headline in the news article with some heuristic rules. We use the script1 released by Rush et al. (2015) to pre-process and extract the training and development datasets. The script performs various basic text normalization, including PTB tokenization, lower-casing, replacing all digit characters with #, and replacing word types seen less than 5 times with 〈unk〉. The extracted corpus contains about 3.8M sentence-summary pairs for the training set and 189K examples for the development set.\nFor our test set, we use the English Gigaword, DUC 2004, and Microsoft Research Abstractive Text Compression test sets.\nEnglish Gigaword Test Set We randomly sample 8000 pairs from the extracted development set as our development set since it is relatively large. For the test set, we use the same randomly heldout test set of 2000 sentence-summary pairs as Rush et al. (2015).2\nWe also find that except for the empty titles, this test set has some invalid lines like the input sentence containing only one word. Therefore, we further sample 2000 pairs as our internal test set and release it for future works.\nDUC 2004 Test Set We employ DUC 2004 data for tasks 1 & 2 (Over et al., 2007) in our experiments as one of the test sets since it is too small to train a neural network model on. The dataset pairs each document with 4 different human-written reference summaries which are capped at 75 bytes. It has 500 input sentences with each sentence paired with 4 summaries.\n1https://github.com/facebook/NAMAS 2Thanks to Rush et al. (2015), we acquired the test set they used. Following Chopra et al. (2016), we remove pairs with empty titles resulting in slightly different accuracy compared to Rush et al. (2015) for their systems. The cleaned test set contains 1951 sentence-summary pairs.\nMSR-ATC Test Set Toutanova et al. (2016) release a new dataset for sentence summarization task by crowdsourcing. This dataset contains approximately 6,000 source text sentences with multiple manually-created summaries (about 26,000 sentence-summary pairs in total). Toutanova et al. (2016) provide a standard split of the data into training, development, and test sets, with 4,936, 448 and 785 input sentences respectively. Since the training set is too small, we only use the test set as one of our test sets.

We use dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) with probability p = 0.5.\nModel Training We initialize model parameters randomly using a Gaussian distribution with Xavier scheme (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). We use a combination of Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015)\nand simple SGD as our the optimizing algorithms. The training is separated into two phases, the first phase is optimizing the loss function with Adam and the second is with simple SGD. For the Adam optimizer, we set the learning rate α = 0.001, two momentum parameters β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.999 respectively, and = 10−8. We use Adam optimizer until the training perplexity decrease to threshold 50. Then we switch to a simple SGD optimizer with initial learning rate α = 0.5 and halve it for every 300K batches. We also apply gradient clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013) with range [−5, 5] for both Adam and SGD phases. To both speed up the training and converge quickly, we use mini-batch size 64 by grid search.\nBeam Search We use beam search to generate multiple summary candidates to get better results. To avoid favoring shorter outputs, we average the ranking score along the beam path by dividing it by the number of generated words. To both decode fast and get better results, we set the beam size to 12 in our experiments."

For English Gigaword4 and MSR-ATC5 test sets, the outputs have different lengths so we evaluate the system with F1 metric. As for the DUC 2004 test set6, the task requires the system to produce a fixed length summary (75 bytes), therefore we employ ROUGE recall as the evaluation metric. To satisfy the length requirement, we decode the output summary to a roughly expected length following Rush et al. (2015).\nEnglish Gigaword We acquire the test set from Rush et al. (2015) so we can make fair comparisons to the baselines.\nIn Table 3, we report the ROUGE F1 score of our model and the baseline methods. Our SEASS model with beam search outperforms all baseline models by a large margin.

The performance on our internal test set is comparable to our development set, which achieves 24.58 ROUGE-2 F1 and outperforms the baselines.\nDUC 2004 We evaluate our model using the ROUGE recall score since the reference summaries\nof the DUC 2004 test set are capped at 75 bytes.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reports ROUGE metric scores on the MSR-ATC dataset. Note that we only compare our model with ABS since the others are not publicly available.

      "text" : "In this section, we first compare the performance of SEASS with the s2s+att baseline model to illustrate that the proposed method succeeds in selecting information and building tailored representation for abstractive sentence summarization. We then analyze selective encoding by visualizing the heat map.\nEffectiveness of Selective Encoding We further test the SEASS model with different sentence lengths on English Gigaword test sets, which are merged from the Rush et al. (2015) test set and our internal test set. The length of sentences in the test sets ranges from 10 to 80. We group the sentences\nwith an interval of 4 and get 18 different groups and we draw the first 14 groups. We find that the performance curve of our SEASS model always appears to be on the top of that of s2s+att with a certain margin. For the groups of 16, 20, 24, 32, 56 and 60, the SEASS model obtains big improvements compared to the s2s+att model. Overall, these improvements on all groups indicate that the selective encoding method benefits the abstractive sentence summarization task.\nSaliency Heat Map of Selective Gate Since the output of the selective gate network is a high dimension vector, it is hard to visualize all the gate values. We use the method in Li et al. (2016) to visualize the contribution of the selective gate to the final output, which can be approximated by the first derivative. Given sentence words x with associated output summary y, the trained model associates the pair (x, y) with a score Sy(x). The goal is to decide which gate g associated with x makes the most significant contribution to Sy(x). We approximate the Sy(g) by computing the first-order Taylor expansion\nSy(g) ≈ ∂(Sy)\n∂g g + b (19)\nWe then draw the Euclidean norm of the first derivative of the output y with respect to the selective gate g associated with each input words.\nFigure 4 shows an example of the first derivative heat map, in which most of the important words are selected by the selective gate such as “europe”, “slammed”, “unacceptable”, “conditions”,\nand “france”. We can observe that the selective gate determines the importance of each word before decoder, which releases the burden of it by providing tailored sentence encoding."

It consists of a sentence encoder, a selective gate network, and an attention equipped decoder. The sentence encoder and decoder are built with recurrent neural networks. The selective gate network constructs a second level sentence representation by controlling the information flow from encoder to decoder. The second level representation is tailored for sentence summarization task, which leads to better performance. We evaluate our model on the English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and MSR abstractive sentence summarization datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed selective encoding model outperforms the state-ofthe-art baseline models.",
