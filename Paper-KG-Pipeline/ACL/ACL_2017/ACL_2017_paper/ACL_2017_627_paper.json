      "text" : "The design of intelligent assistants which interact with users in natural language ranks high on the agenda of current NLP research. With an increasing focus on the use of statistical and machine learning based approaches (Young et al., 2013), the last few years have seen some truly remarkable conversational agents appear on the market (e.g. Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Allo). These agents can perform simple tasks, answer factual questions, and sometimes also aimlessly chit-chat with the user, but they still lag far be-\nhind a human assistant in terms of both the variety and complexity of tasks they can perform. In particular, they lack the ability to learn from interactions with a user in order to improve and adapt with time. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been explored to leverage user interactions to adapt various dialogue agents designed, respectively, for task completion (Gašić et al., 2013), information access (Wen et al., 2016b), and chitchat (Li et al., 2016a).\nWe focus on KB-InfoBots, a particular type of dialogue agent that helps users navigate a Knowledge Base (KB) in search of an entity, as illustrated by the example in Figure 1. Such agents must necessarily query databases in order to retrieve the requested information. This is usually done by performing semantic parsing on the input to construct a symbolic query representing the beliefs of the agent about the user goal (see, e.g., Wen et al. (2016b) and Williams and Zweig (2016)). We call such an operation a HardKB lookup. While natural, this approach has two drawbacks: (1) the retrieved results do not carry any information about uncertainty in semantic parsing, and (2) the retrieval operation is non differentiable, and hence the parser and dialog policy are trained separately. This makes online endto-end learning from user feedback difficult once the system is deployed.\nIn this work, we propose a probabilistic framework for computing the posterior distribution of the user target over a knowledge base, which we term a Soft-KB lookup. This distribution is constructed from the agent’s belief about the attributes of the entity being searched for. The dialogue policy network, which decides the next system action, receives as input this full distribution instead of a handful of retrieved results. We show in our experiments that this framework allows the agent to achieve a higher task success rate in fewer dia-\n2\nACL 2017 Submission 627. Confidential Review Copy.

Reinforcement learners typically require an environment to interact with, and hence static dialogue corpora cannot be used for their training. Running experiments on human subjects, on the other hand, is unfortunately too expensive. A common workaround in the dialogue community (Young et al., 2013; Schatzmann et al., 2007b; Scheffler and Young, 2002) is to instead use user simulators which mimic the behavior of real users in a consistent manner. For training KB-InfoBot, we adapt the publicly available1 simulator described in Li et al. (2016b). Evaluation of dialogue agents has been the subject of much research (Walker et al., 1997; Möller et al., 2006). While the metrics for evaluating an InfoBot are relatively clear — the agent should return the correct entity in a minimum number of turns — the environment for testing it not so much. Unlike previous KB-based QA systems, our focus is on multi-turn interactions, and as such there are no publicly available benchmarks for this problem. We evaluate several versions of KB-InfoBot with the simulator and on real users, and show that the proposed Soft-KB lookup helps the reinforcement learner discover better dialogue policies. Initial experiments on the end-to-end agent also demonstrate its strong learning capability."

      "text" : "Our work is motivated by the neural GenQA (Yin et al., 2016a) and neural enquirer (Yin et al., 2016b) models for querying KBs via natural language in a fully “neuralized” way. However, the 1 https://github.com/MiuLab/UserSimulator\nkey difference is that these systems assume that users can compose a complicated, compositional natural language query that can uniquely identify the element/answer in the KB. The research task is to parse the query, i.e., turning the natural language query into a sequence of SQL-like operations. Instead we focus on how to query a KB interactively without composing such complicated queries in the first place. Our work is motivated by the observations that (1) users are more used to issuing simple queries of length less than 5 words (Spink et al., 2001); (2) in many cases, it is unreasonable to assume that users can construct compositional queries without prior knowledge of the structure of the KB to be queried. Also related is the growing body of literature focused on building end-to-end dialogue systems, which combine feature extraction and policy optimization using deep neural networks. Wen et al. (2016b) introduced a modular neural dialogue agent, which uses a Hard-KB lookup, thus breaking the differentiability of the whole system. As a result, training of various components of the dialogue system is performed separately. The intent network and belief trackers are trained using supervised labels specifically collected for them; while the policy network and generation network are trained separately on the system utterances. We retain modularity of the network by keeping the belief trackers separate, but replace the hard lookup with a differentiable one. Dialogue agents can also interface with the database by augmenting their output action space with predefined API calls (Williams and Zweig, 2016; Zhao and Eskenazi, 2016; Bordes and Weston, 2016). The API calls modify a query hypothesis maintained outside the end-to-end system which is used to retrieve results from this KB. This framework does not deal with uncertainty in language understanding since the query hypothesis can only hold one slot-value at a time. Our approach, on the other hand, directly models the uncertainty to construct the posterior over the KB. Wu et al. (2015) presented an entropy minimization dialogue management strategy for InfoBots. The agent always asks for the value of the slot with maximum entropy over the remaining entries in the database, which is optimal in the absence of LU errors, and serves as a baseline against our approach. Reinforcement learning neural turing machines (RL-NTM) (Zaremba and Sutskever,\n3 ACL 2017 Submission 627. Confidential Review Copy. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE. 2015) also allow neural controllers to interact with discrete external interfaces. The interface considered in that work is a one-dimensional memory tape, while in our work it is an entity-centric KB."

We do not deal with new entities or relations at test time. We assume a uniform prior G ∼ U [{1, ...N}] over the rows in the table T , and let binary random variables Φj ∈ {0, 1} indicate whether the user knows the value of slot j or not. The agent maintains M multinomial distributions ptj(v) for v ∈ V j denoting the probability at turn t that the user constraint for slot j is v, given their utterances U t1 till that turn. The agent also maintains M binomials qtj = Pr(Φj = 1) which denote the probability that the user knows the value of slot j. We assume that column values are independently distributed to each other.

We adopt a modular approach, typical to goaloriented dialogue systems (see for e.g. (Wen et al., 2016b)), consisting of: a belief tracker (LU) module for identifying user intents, extracting associated slots, and tracking the dialogue state (Yao et al., 2014; Hakkani-Tür et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Henderson et al., 2014; Henderson, 2015); an interface with the database to query for relevant results (Soft-KB lookup); a summary module to summarize the state into a vector; a dialogue policy which selects the next system action based on current state (Young et al., 2013).

We describe two versions of the belief tracker. Hand-Crafted Tracker: We first identify mentions of slot-names (such as “actor”) or slot-values (such as “Bill Murray”) from the user input ut, using token-level keyword search. Let {w ∈ x} denote the set of tokens in a string x2, then for each slot in 1 ≤ j ≤ M and each value v ∈ V j , we compute its matching score as follows: stj [v] = |{w ∈ ut} ∩ {w ∈ v}| |{w ∈ v}| (4) 2We use the NLTK tokenizer available at http://www. nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html\nA similar score btj is computed for the slot-names. A one-hot vector reqt ∈ {0, 1}M denotes the previously requested slot from the agent, if any. qtj is set to 0 if reqt[j] is 1 but stj [v] = 0 ∀v ∈ V j , i.e. the agent requested for a slot but did not receive a valid value in return, else it is set to 1. Starting from an prior distribution p0j (based on the counts of the values in the KB), ptj [v] is updated as: ptj [v] ∝ pt−1j [v] + C ( stj [v] + b t j + 1(req t[j] = 1) ) (5) Here C is a tuning parameter, and the normalization is given by setting the sum over v to 1. Neural Belief Tracker: For the neural tracker the user input ut is converted to a vector representation xt, using a bag of n-grams (with n = 2) representation. Each element of xt is an integer indicating the count of a particular n-gram in ut. We let V n denote the number of unique n-grams, hence xt ∈ NV n0 . Recurrent neural networks have been used for belief tracking (Henderson et al., 2014; Wen et al., 2016b) since the output distribution at turn t depends on all user inputs till that turn. We use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) for each tracker, which, starting from h0j = 0 computes htj = GRU(x 1, . . . , xt) (see appendix B for details). htj ∈ Rd can be interpreted as a summary of what the user has said about slot j till turn t. The belief states are computed from this vector as follows: ptj = softmax(W p j h t j + b p j ) (6) qtj = σ(W Φ j h t j + b Φ j ) (7) Here W pj ∈ RV j×d, bpj ∈ RV j , WΦj ∈ Rd and bΦj ∈ R, are trainable parameters."

Each slot is summarized into an entropy statistic over a distribution wtj computed from elements of the KB posterior ptT as follows: wtj(v) ∝ ∑ i:Ti,j=v ptT (i) + p 0 j (v) ∑ i:Ti,j=Ψ ptT (i) . (8) Here, p0j is a prior distribution over the values of slot j, estimated using counts of each value in the KB. The probability mass of v in this distribution is the agent’s confidence that the user goal has value v in slot j. This two terms in (8) correspond to rows in KB which have value v, and rows whose value is unknown (weighted by the prior probability that an unknown might be v). Then the summary statistic for slot j is the entropy H(wtj). The KB posterior ptT is also summarized into an entropy statistic H(ptT ). The scalar probabilities qtj are passed as is to the dialogue policy, and the final summary vector is s̃t = [H(p̃t1), ...,H(p̃ t M ), q t 1, ..., q t M , H(p t T )].

Neural Policy Network: For the neural approach, similar to (Williams and Zweig, 2016; Zhao and Eskenazi, 2016), we use an RNN to allow the network to maintain an internal state of dialogue history. Specifically, we use a GRU unit followed by a fully-connected layer and softmax nonlinearity to model the policy π over actions in A (W π ∈ R|A|×d, bπ ∈ R|A|): htπ = GRU(s̃ 1, ..., s̃t) (9) π = softmax(W πhtπ + b π) . (10) During training, the agent samples its actions from the policy to encourage exploration. If this action is inform(), it must also provide an ordered set of entities indexed by I = (i1, i2, . . . , iR) in the KB to the user. This is done by sampling R items from the KB-posterior ptT .

We assume that the learner has access to a reward signal rt throughout the course of the dialogue, details of which are in the next section. We can write the expected discounted return of the agent under policy π as J(θ) = Eπ [∑H t=0 γ trt ] (γ is the discounting factor). When only training the dialogue policy π using this signal, updates are given by (details in Appendix D): ∇θJ(θ) = Eπ [ H∑ k=0 ∇θ log πθ(ak) H∑ t=0 γtrt ] , (11) For end-to-end training we need to update both the dialogue policy and the belief trackers using the reinforcement signal, and we can view the retrieval as another policy µθ (see Appendix D). The updates are given by: ∇θJ(θ) =Ea∼π,I∼µ [( ∇θ logµθ(I)+ H∑ h=0 ∇θ log πθ(ah) ) H∑ k=0 γkrk ] , (12) In the case of end-to-end learning, we found that for a moderately sized KB, the agent almost always fails if starting from random initialization. In this case, credit assignment is difficult for the agent, since it does not know whether the failure is due to an incorrect sequence of actions or incorrect set of results from the KB. Hence, at the beginning of training we have an Imitation Learning (IL) phase where the belief trackers and policy network are trained to mimic the hand-crafted agents. Assume that p̂tj and q̂ t j are the belief states from a rule-based agent, and ât its action at turn t. Then the loss function for imitation learning is: L(θ) = E [ D(p̂tj ||ptj(θ))+H(q̂tj , qtj(θ))−log πθ(ât) ] . D(p||q) and H(p, q) denote the KL divergence and cross-entropy between p and q respectively. The expectations are estimated using a minibatch of dialogues of size B.

We compare three variants of both sets of agents, which differ only in the inputs to the dialogue policy. The No-KB version only takes entropy H(p̂tj) of each of the slot distributions. The Hard-KB version performs a hard-KB lookup and selects the next action based on the entropy of the slots over retrieved results. This is the same approach as in (Wen et al., 2016b), except that we take entropy instead of summing probabilities. The Soft-KB version takes summary statistics of the slots and KB posterior described in Section 4.

Note that, except the E2E version, all versions share the same belief trackers, but by re-asking values of some slots they can have different posteriors ptT to inform the results. This shows that having full information about the current state of beliefs over the KB helps the Soft-KB agent discover better policies. Further, reinforcement learning helps discover better policies than the handcrafted rule-based agents, and we see a higher reward for RL agents compared to Rule ones. This is due to the noisy natural language inputs; with perfect information the rule-based strategy is optimal. Interestingly, the RL-Hard agent has the minimum number of turns in 2 out of the 4 settings, at the cost of a lower success rate and average reward. This agent does not receive any information about the uncertainty in semantic parsing, and it tends to inform as soon as the number of retrieved results becomes small, even if they are incorrect. Among the Soft-KB agents, we see that E2E>RL>Rule, except for the X-Large KB. For E2E, the action space grows exponentially with the size of the KB, and hence credit assignment gets more difficult. Future work should focus on improving the E2E agent in this setting. The difficulty of a KB-split depends on number of entities it has, as well as the number of unique values for each slot (more unique values make the problem easier). Hence we see that both the “Small” and “X-Large” settings lead to lower reward for the agents, since maxj |V j | N is small for them.\nFigure 3: Performance of KB-InfoBot versions when tested against real users.

In each session, the subject was first presented with a target movie from the “Medium” KB-split along with a subset of its associated slot-values from the KB. To simulate the scenario where end-users may not know slot values correctly, the subjects in our evaluation were presented multiple values for the slots from which they could choose any one while interacting with the agent. Subjects were asked to initiate the conversation by specifying some of these values, and respond to the agent’s subsequent requests, all in natural language.

In comparing Hard-KB versus Soft-KB lookup methods we see that both Rule-Soft and RL-Soft agents achieve a higher success rate than RL-Hard, while E2E-Soft does comparably. They do so in an increased number of average turns, but achieve a\n8\nACL 2017 Submission 627. Confidential Review Copy. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE.\nhigher average reward as well. Between RL-Soft and Rule-Soft agents, the success rate is similar, however the RL agent achieves that rate in a lower number of turns on average. RL-Soft achieves a success rate of 74% on the human evaluation and 80% against the simulated user, indicating minimal overfitting. However, all agents take a higher number of turns against real users as compared to the simulator, due to the noisier inputs. The E2E gets the highest success rate against the simulator, however, when tested against real users it performs poorly with a lower success rate and a higher number of turns. Since it has more trainable components, this agent is also most prone to overfitting. In particular, the vocabulary of the simulator it is trained against is quite limited (V n = 3078), and hence when real users provided inputs outside this vocabulary, it performed poorly. In the future we plan to fix this issue by employing a better architecture for the LU and Belief Tracker components (such as the one used in Hakkani-Tür et al. (2016)), as well as by pretraining on separate data. While its generalization performance is poor, the E2E system also exhibits the strongest learn-\ning capability. In Figure 5, we compare how different agents perform against the simulator as the temperature of the output softmax in its NLG is increased. A higher temperature means a more uniform output distribution, which leads to generic simulator responses irrelevant to the agent questions. This is a simple way of introducing noise in the utterances. The performance of all agents drops as the temperature is increased, but less so for the E2E agent, which can adapt its belief tracker to the inputs it receives. Such adaptation is key to the personalization of dialogue agents, which motivates us to introduce the E2E agent."

We present an E2E agent for the task, which demonstrates a strong learning capacity in simulations but suffers from overfitting when tested on real users. Given these results, we propose the following deployment strategy that allows a dialogue system to be tailored to specific users via learning from agent-user interactions. The system could start off with an RL-Soft agent (which gives good performance out-of-the-box). As the user interacts with this agent, the collected data can be used to train the E2E agent, which has a strong learning capability. Gradually, as more experience is collected, the system can switch from RL-Soft to the personalized E2E agent. Effective implementation of this, however, requires the E2E agent to learn quickly and this is the research direction we plan to focus on in the future.\n9 ACL 2017 Submission 627.

If the agent informs results from the KB, the simulator checks whether the target is among them and provides the reward.\nWe convert dialogue acts from the user into natural language utterances using a separately trained natural language generator (NLG). The NLG is trained in a sequence-to-sequence fashion, using conversations between humans collected by crowd-sourcing. It takes the dialogue actions (DAs) as input, and generates template-like sentences with slot placeholders via an LSTM decoder. Then, a post-processing scan is performed to replace the slot placeholders with their actual values, which is similar to the decoder module in (Wen et al., 2015, 2016a). In the LSTM decoder, we apply beam search, which iteratively considers the top k best sentences up to time step t when generating the token of the time step t+ 1. For the sake of the trade-off between the speed and performance, we use the beam size of 3 in the following experiments.\nThere are several sources of error in user utterances. Any value provided by the user may be corrupted by noise, or substituted completely with an incorrect value of the same type (e.g., “Bill Murray” might become just “Bill” or “Tom Cruise”). The NLG described above is inherently stochastic, and may sometimes generate utterances irrelevant to the agent request. By increasing the temperature of the output softmax in the NLG we can increase the noise in user utterances."

Such goal-oriented dialogue agents typically need to interact with an external database to access real-world knowledge. Previous systems achieved this by issuing a symbolic query to the KB to retrieve entries based on their attributes. However, such symbolic operations break the differentiability of the system and prevent endto-end training of neural dialogue agents. In this paper, we address this limitation by replacing symbolic queries with an induced “soft” posterior distribution over the KB that indicates which entities the user is interested in. Integrating the soft retrieval process with a reinforcement learner leads to higher task success rate and reward in both simulations and against real users. We also present a fully neural end-to-end agent, trained entirely from user feedback, and discuss its application towards personalized dialogue agents.",
