Although language impairment is an important marker it is frequently undervalued in cognitive assessments. Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI. However, MCI disfluencies produce agrammatical speech impacting in parsing results; manually correcting transcripts of patient’s speech is not a solution to large scale assessments. In this paper, we use complex network features to automatically identifying MCI in transcripts, using several classification algorithms, as it a lightweight and language independent representation. We modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embeddings to better represent short texts produced in assessments. We evaluate our model in three datasets: one from the DementiaBank; Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese were produced by assessments applied at University of São Paulo Medical School. The results show that complex networks are suitable to detect MCI and outperform linguistic features in all datasets. We also combined the classifiers through ensemble and multi-view learning. The ensemble of algorithms and multi-view method achieved 10% of improvement in Cinderella dataset compared to the best individual classifier. For the Arizona dataset, the multi-view achieved the highest accuracy (80%), a 4.71% of improvement."

      "text" : "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) can affect one or multiple cognitive domains (e.g. memory, language, visuospatial skills and the executive function), and may represent a pre-clinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The impairment that affects memory, referred to as amnestic MCI, is the most frequent, with the highest conversion rate for AD, at 15% a year versus 1 to 2% for the general population. Since dementias are chronic and progressive diseases, their early diagnosis ensures a greater chance of success to engage patients in non-pharmacological treatment strategies such as cognitive training, physical activity and socialization (Teixeira et al., 2012).\nLanguage is one of the most efficient information sources for assessing cognitive functions. Changes in language usage are frequent in patients with dementia and are normally first recognized by the patients themselves or their family members. Therefore, the automatic analysis of discourse production is promising for diagnosing MCI at early stages, which may address potentially reversible factors (Muangpaisan et al., 2012). Proposals to detect language-related impairment in dementias include machine learning (Jarrold et al., 2010; Roark et al., 2011; Fraser et al., 2014, 2015), magnetic resonance imaging (Dyrba et al., 2015), and data screening tests added to demographic information (Weakley et al., 2015). The discourse production (mainly narratives) is attractive because it allows for the analysis of linguistic microstructures, including phonetic-phonological, morphosyntactic and semantic-lexical components, as well as semanticpragmatic macrostructures.\nAutomated discourse analysis based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources and tools to diagnose dementias via machine learning meth-\n2 ACL 2017 Submission ***.

A variety of features are required for this analysis, including Part-of-Speech (PoS), syntactic complexity, lexical diversity and acoustics features. Producing robust tools to extract these features is extremely difficult because speech transcripts used in neuropsychological evaluations contain disfluencies (repetitions, revisions, paraphasias) and patient’s comments about the task being evaluated. Another problem in using linguistic knowledge is the high dependence on manually created resources, such as hand-crafted linguistic rules and/or annotated corpora. Even when traditional statistical techniques (Bag of Words (BoW) or ngrams) are applied they also have problems to deal with disfluencies. An approach applied successfully to several areas of NLP (Mihalcea and Radev, 2011), which may suffer less from the problems mentioned above, relies on the use of complex networks and graph theory. The word adjacency network model (i Cancho and Solé, 2001; Roxas and Tapang, 2010; Amancio et al., 2012a; Amancio, 2015b) has provided good results in text classification (de Arruda et al., 2016) and related tasks, namely author detection (Amancio, 2015a), identification of literary movements (Amancio et al., 2012c), authenticity verification (Amancio et al., 2013) and sense discrimination (Amancio et al., 2012b). In this paper, we show that speech transcripts (narratives or descriptions) can be modeled into complex networks that are enriched with word embeddings. We modeled narratives and short descriptions into complex networks and enriched them with word embeddings to better represent short texts produced in these assessments. When applied to a machine learning classifier, the complex network features were able to distinguish between control participants and mild cognitive impairment participants. Discrimination of the two classes could be improved by combining complex networks with linguistic and traditional statistical features; we also identified the best scenario for application of network features extracted from transcripts of neuropsychological assessments."

      "text" : "Detection of memory impairment has been based on linguistic, acoustic, and demographic features, in addition to scores of neuropsychological tests. Linguistic and acoustic features were used to automatically detect aphasia (Fraser et al., 2014); and AD (Fraser et al., 2015) or dementia (Orimaye et al., 2014) in public corpora of DementiaBank. Other studies distinguished differents types of dementia (Garrard et al., 2014; Jarrold et al., 2014), in which speech samples were elicited using the Picnic picture of the Western Aphasia Battery. Davy et al. (2016) also used the Picnic scene for detecting MCI, where the subjects were asked to write (by hand) a detailed description of the scene. As for automatic detection of MCI in narrative speech, Roark et al. (2011) extracted speech features and linguistic complexity measures of speech samples obtained with the Wechsler Logical Memory (WLM) subtest (Wechsler et al., 1997), and Lehr et al. (2012) fully automatized the WLM subtest. Some studies used short animated films to evaluate immediate and delayed recall in MCI patients which were asked to talk about the first film shown, then about their previous day, and finally about another film shown last. Tóth et al. (2015) adopted automatic speech recognition (ASR) to extract a phonetic level segmentation, which they used to calculate acoustic features. Vincze et al. (2016) used speech, morphological, semantic, and demographic features collected from their speech transcripts to automatically identify patients suffering from MCI. For the Portuguese language, machine learning algorithms were used to identify subjects with AD and MCI. (Aluı́sio et al., 2016) used a variety of linguistic metrics, such as syntactic complexity, idea density (da Cunha et al., 2015), and text cohesion through latent semantics. PLN tools with high precision are needed to compute these metrics, which is a problem for Portuguese since there is no robust dependency or constituency parser. Therefore, the transcriptions had to be manually revised; they were segmented in sentences, following a semantic-structural criterion and capitalization was added afterwards. The authors also removed disfluencies and inserted omitted subjects when they were hidden, in order to reduce parsing errors. This process is obviously expensive, which has motivated us to use complex networks in the\n3\nACL 2017 Submission ***. Confidential Review Copy.

      "text" : "The theory and concepts of complex networks have been used in several NLP tasks (Mihalcea and Radev, 2011; Cong and Liu, 2014), such as text classification (de Arruda et al., 2016), summarization (Antiqueira et al., 2009; Amancio et al., 2012a) and word sense disambiguation (Silva and Amancio, 2012). In this study, we used the word co-occurrence model (also called the word adjacency model) with a small modification because most of the syntactical relations occur among neighbouring words (i Cancho et al., 2004). Each distinct word becomes a node and words that are adjacent in the text are connected by an edge. Mathematically, a network is defined as an undirected graph G = {V,E}, formed by a set V = {v1, v2, ..., vn} of nodes (words) and a set E = {e1, e2, ..., em} of edges (co-occurrence) that are represented by an adjacency matrix A, whose elementsAij are equal to 1 whenever there is an edge connecting nodes (words) i and j, and equal to 0 otherwise. Before modeling texts into complex networks, it is often necessary to do some preprocessing in the raw text. Preprocessing starts with tokenization where each document/text is divided into tokens (meaningful elements, e.g.: words and punctuation marks) and then stopwords and punctuation marks are removed, since they have little semantic meaning. One last step we decided to eliminate from the preprocessing pipeline is lemmatization, which transforms each word into its canonical form. This decision was made based on two factors: first, recent work has shown that lemmatization has little or no influence when network modeling is adopted in related tasks (Machicao et al., 2016). Second, the lemmatization process requires part-of-speech (POS) tagging that may introduce undesirable noises/errors in the text, since the texts in our work are transcriptions containing disfluencies. Another problem with transcriptions in our work is their size. As demonstrated by Amancio (2015c), the classification of small texts using networks can be impaired, since short texts have almost linear networks, and the topological measures of these networks have little or no informa-\nfloor\ntion relevant to classification. To solve this problem, we adapted the approach of modeling networks with word embeddings proposed by Perozzi et al. (2014) to enrich the networks with semantic information. In this process of word embedding, language networks are generated from continuous word representations, where each word is represented by a dense, real-valued vector obtained by trainning neural networks in the language model task (or variations, such as context prediction) (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013a,b). This structure is known to capture syntatic and semantic information (Mikolov et al., 2013a,b). Perozzi et al. (2014), in particular, takes advantage of word embeddings to build networks where each word is a vertice and edges are defined by similarity between words established by the proximity of the word vectors. Following this methodology, in our model we added new edges to the co-occurrence networks considering similarities between words, that is, for all pairs of words in the text that were unconnected, an edge was created if their vectors (from word embedding) had a cosine similarity higher than a given threshold. Figure 1 shows an example of a co-occurrence network enriched by similarity links (the dotted edges).

The exclusion criteria for the normal group were: poorly controlled clinical diseases, sensitive deficits that are not being compensated for and interfere with the performance in tests, other neurological or psychiatric diagnoses that are associated with dementia or cognitive deficits and use of medications in doses that affect cognition. Speech narrative samples were elicited by having participants tell the Cinderella story; participants were given as much time as they needed to examine a picture book illustrating the story (Figure 4 in Section A). When each participant had finished looking at the pictures, the examiner asked the subject to tell the story in their own words, as in (Saffran et al., 1989). The time was recorded, but there was no limit imposed to the narrative length. If the participant had difficulty initiating, continuing speech, or presenting a long pause, an evaluator used a stimulus question “What happens next ?”, seeking to encourage the participant to continue his/her narrative. When the subject was unable to proceed with the narrative, the examiner asked if he/she had finalized the story and had something to add. Each speech sample was recorded and then manually transcribed at the word level following the NURC/SP N. 338 EF and 331 D2 transcription norms. Other tests were applied after the narrative in the following sequence: phonemic verbal fluency test, action verbal fluency, Camel and Cactus test (Bozeat et al., 2000), and Boston Naming test (Kaplan et al., 2001), in order to diagnose the groups.

Since the occurrence of out-of-vocabulary words is common in texts, we used the method proposed by (Bojanowski et al., 2016) to generate word embeddings. This method extends the skipgram model to use character-level information, with each word being represented as a bag of character n-grams. It provides some improvement in comparison with the traditional skip-gram model in syntactic evaluation (Mikolov et al., 2013b) but not for the semantic evaluation. Once the network has been enriched with semantic information, we characterize its topology using the following ten measurements: 1. PageRank: is a centrality measurement that reflects the relevance of a node based on its connections to other relevant nodes (Brin and Page, 1998); 2. Betweenness: is a centrality measurement that considers a node as relevant if it is highly accessed via shortest paths. The betweenness of a node v is defined as the fraction of shortest paths going through node v; 3. Eccentricity: of a node is calculated by measuring the shortest distance from the node to all other vertices in the graph and taking the maximum; 4. Eigenvector centrality: is a measurement that defines the importance of a node based on its connectivity to high-rank nodes; 5. Average Degree of the Neighbors of a Node: is the average of the degrees of all its direct neighbors;\n6. Average Shortest Path Length of a Node: is the average distance between this node and all other nodes of the network; 7. Degree: is the number of edges connected to the node; 8. Assortativity Degree: or degree correlation measures the tendency of nodes to connect to other nodes that have similar degree; 9. Diameter: is defined as the maximum shortest path; 10. Clustering Coefficient: measures the probability that two neighbors of a node are connected. Most of the measurements described above are local measurements, i.e. each node i possesses a value Xi, so we calculate the average µ(X), standard deviation σ(X) and skewness γ(X) for each measurement (Amancio, 2015b)."

We also combine these classifiers through ensemble and multi-view learning. In ensemble learning, multiple models/classifiers are generated and combined using, e.g. majority vote or average of class probabilities, to produce a single result (Zhou, 2012). In multi-view learning, multiple classifiers are trained in different feature spaces and thus combined to produce a single result. This approach is an elegant solution rather than combining all features in the same vector or space, primarily because the combination is not a straightforward step, which can lead to noise insertion, since the data have different natures. Secondly, using different classifiers for each feature space allows different weights to be given for each type of feature, weights that can be learned by a 4http://143.107.183.175:22380 regression method to improve the model.

The accuracies found here are comparable to the values reported by other authors, ranging from 60% to 85% (Prud’hommeaux and Roark, 2011; Lehr et al., 2012; Tóth et al., 2015; Vincze et al., 2016), which means that it is not easy to distinguish between healthy subjects and those with cognitive impairments. The comparison with our results is not straightforward, though, because the databases used in the studies are different. There is a clear need of publicly available datasets to compare different methods, which would allow for optimizing detection of MCI in elderly people. As future work, we intend to explore other methods to enrich CN, such as Recurrent Language Model language, and other metrics to characterize an adjacency network. The pursue of these strategies is relevant because language is one of the most efficient information sources for assessing cognitive functions, commonly used in neuropsychological assessments.\n9 ACL 2017 Submission ***.

    "abstractText" : "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a mental disorder difficult to diagnose. Although language impairment is an important marker it is frequently undervalued in cognitive assessments. Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI. However, MCI disfluencies produce agrammatical speech impacting in parsing results; manually correcting transcripts of patient’s speech is not a solution to large scale assessments. In this paper, we use complex network features to automatically identifying MCI in transcripts, using several classification algorithms, as it a lightweight and language independent representation. We modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embeddings to better represent short texts produced in assessments. We evaluate our model in three datasets: one from the DementiaBank; Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese were produced by assessments applied at University of São Paulo Medical School. The results show that complex networks are suitable to detect MCI and outperform linguistic features in all datasets. We also combined the classifiers through ensemble and multi-view learning. The ensemble of algorithms and multi-view method achieved 10% of improvement in Cinderella dataset compared to the best individual classifier. For the Arizona dataset, the multi-view achieved the highest accuracy (80%), a 4.71% of improvement.",
