      "text" : "Predicate argument structure (PAS) analysis is a basic semantic analysis task, in which systems are required to identify semantic units of a sentence, such as who did what to whom. In pro-drop languages such as Japanese, Chinese and Italian, arguments are often omitted in text, and such argument omission is regarded as one of the most problematic issues of PAS analysis (Iida and Poesio, 2011; Sasano and Kurohashi, 2011).\nAs an approach to the argument omission problem, in Japanese PAS analysis, joint modeling of interactions between multiple predicates has been gaining popularity and achieved the state-of-theart result (Ouchi et al., 2015; Shibata et al., 2016). This approach is based on the linguistic intuition that the predicates in a sentence are semantically related to each other and the interaction information can be a clue for PAS analysis. However, to model such multi-predicate interactions, this ap-\nproach heavily relies on syntactic information predicted by parsers and suffers from the error propagation caused by the pipeline processing.\nTo remedy this problem, we propose a neural model which automatically induces features sensitive to multi-predicate interactions from word sequence information of a sentence. This model takes as input all predicates and their argument candidates in a sentence at a time, and captures the interactions using grid-type recurrent neural networks (Grid-RNN) without syntactic information.\nIn this paper, we firstly introduce a basic model using RNNs, which independently estimates arguments of each predicate without considering the multi-predicate interactions (Sec. 3). Then, extending this model, we propose a neural model using Grid-RNNs (Sec. 4).\nPerforming experiments on the NAIST Text Corpus (Iida et al., 2007), we demonstrate that our neural models exceed the accuracy of the stateof-the-art Japanese PAS analyzer (Ouchi et al., 2015). In particular, the neural model using GridRNNs achieves the best result, which suggests that our grid-type neural architecture effectively captures multi-predicate interactions. 1\n1Our source code is publicly available at http:xxx"

      "text" : "In Japanese PAS analysis, we identify arguments taking part in the three major case roles, nominative (NOM), accusative (ACC) and dative (DAT) cases, for each predicate. Arguments can be divided into the following three categories according to the positions relative to their predicates (Hayashibe et al., 2011; Ouchi et al., 2015):\nDep: The arguments that have direct syntactic dependency with the predicate.\nZero: The arguments referred to by zero pronouns within the same sentence, which have no direct syntactic dependency with the predicate.\nInter-Zero: The arguments referred to by zero pronouns out of the same sentence.\nFor example, in Figure 1, the nominative argument “警察 (police)” for the predicate “逮捕した (arrested)” is regarded as a Dep argument since the argument has a direct syntactic dependency with the predicate. In contrast, the nominative argument “男 i (mani)” for the predicate “逃走した (escaped)” is regarded as a Zero argument since the argument has no direct syntactic dependency with the predicate.\nIn this paper, we focus on the analysis for these intra-sentential arguments, i.e., Dep and Zero. In order to identify inter-sentential arguments (Inter-Zero), it is required to search a much broader space, such as the whole document, resulting in a much harder analysis than intrasentential arguments.2 Thus, Ouchi et al. (2015)\n2The F-measure remains 10-20% (Taira et al., 2008; Imamura et al., 2009; Sasano and Kurohashi, 2011).\nand Shibata et al. (2016) focused on only intrasentential argument analysis. Following this trend, we focus on intra-sentential argument analysis."

      "text" : "Arguments are often omitted in Japanese sentences. In Figure 1, ϕi represents the omitted argument, called zero pronoun. This zero pronoun ϕi refers to “男 i (mani)”. In Japanese PAS analysis, when an argument of the target predicate is omitted, we have to identify the antecedent of the omitted argument (Zero argument).\nThe analysis for such Zero arguments is much more difficult than that for Dep arguments because of the lack of direct syntactic dependencies. For Dep arguments, the syntactic dependency between an argument and its predicate is a strong clue. In the sentence in Figure 1, for the predicate “逮捕し た (arrested)”, the nominative argument is “警察 (police)”. This argument can easily be identified by relying on the syntactic dependency. In contrast, since the nominative argument “男 i (mani)” has no syntactic dependency with its predicate “逃 走した (escaped)”, we have to use other information for such zero argument identification.\nAs an solution to this problem, we exploit two kinds of information: (i) context in the entire sentence and (ii) multi-predicate interactions. For the former, we introduce single-sequence model, which induces context-sensitive representations from a sequence of argument candidates of a predicate. For the latter, we introduce multi-sequence model, which induces predicate-sensitive representations from multiple sequences of argument candidates of all predicates in a sentence (shown in Figure 2)."

Similarly, as the PRED feature, we extract each word index xword of the C words taking the target predicate at the center, where C is the window size. The MARK feature xmark ∈ {0, 1} is a binary value that represents whether the word is the predicate or not.\nThen, using feature indices, we extract feature vector representations from each embedding matrix. Figure 5 shows the process of creating the feature vector x1 for the word w1 “彼女 (she)”. We set two embedding matrices: (i) word embedding matrix Eword ∈ Rdword×|V|, and (ii) mark embedding matrix Emark ∈ Rdmark×2.

In the constituent-based SRL, since systems are required to identify the spans of arguments for each predicate, Zhou and Xu (2015) used CRF to capture the IOB label dependencies. In contrast, in Japanese dependency-based PAS analysis, since arguments are infrequently adjacent to each other, we replaced the CRF with the softmax function. Also, while the model of Zhou and Xu (2015) predicts arguments for each predicate independently, our multi-sequence model jointly predicts arguments for all predicates in a sentence at a time by considering the multi-predicate interactions.\n4These previous studies used unpublished datasets and evaluated the performance with different experimental settings, so we cannot compare their models with ours."
