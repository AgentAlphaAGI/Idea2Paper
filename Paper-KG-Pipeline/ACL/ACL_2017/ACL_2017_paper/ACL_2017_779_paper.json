      "text" : "Neural machine translation (NMT) (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014), which directly models the translation process in an end-to-end way, has attracted intensive attention from the community. Although NMT has achieved state-of-theart translation performance on resource-rich language pairs such as English-French and GermanEnglish (Luong et al., 2015; Jean et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016), it still suffers from the unavailability of large-scale parallel corpora for translating low resource languages. Due to the large parameter space, neural models usually learn poorly from low-count events, resulting in a poor choice for low resource language pairs. Zoph et al. (2016) indicate that NMT obtains much worse translation quality than a statistical machine translation\n(SMT) system on low-resource languages. As a result, a number of authors have endeavored to explore methods for translating language pairs without parallel corpora available. These methods can be roughly divided into two broad categories: multilingual and pivot-based. Firat et al. (2016b) present a multi-way, multilingual model with shared attention to achieve zeroresource translation. They fine-tune the attention part using pseudo bilingual sentences for the zeroresource language pair. Another direction is to develop a universal NMT model in multilingual scenarios (Johnson et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016). They use parallel corpora of multiple languages to train one single model, which is then able to translate a language pair without parallel corpora available. Although these approaches prove to be effective, the combination of multiple languages in modeling and training leads to significantly increased complexity.\nAnother direction is to achieve source-to-target NMT without parallel data via a pivot, which is either text (Cheng et al., 2016) or image (Nakayama and Nishida, 2016b). Cheng et al. (2016) propose a pivot-based method to zero-resource NMT: it first translates the source language to a pivot language, which is then translated to the target language. Nakayama and Nishida (2016b) show that using multimedia information as pivot also significantly benefit zero-resource translation. However, pivot-based approaches usually need to divide the decoding process into two steps, which is not only more computationally expensive, but also potentially suffers from the error propagation problem (Zhu et al., 2013).\nIn this paper, we propose a new method for zero-resource neural machine translation. Our method assumes that parallel sentences should have close probabilities of generating a sentence in a third language. To train a source-to-target NMT\nmodel without parallel corpora (“student”), we leverage an existing pivot-to-target NMT model (“teacher”) to guide the learning process of the student model on a source-pivot parallel corpus. As compared with the pivot-based approaches (Cheng et al., 2016; Nakayama and Nishida, 2016b), our method allows direct modeling of the intended NMT model, without the need to divide training or decoding into two steps. This strategy not only improves efficiency but also avoids error propagation in decoding. Experiments on the Europarl and WMT datasets show that our approach achieves significant improvements in terms of both translation quality and decoding efficiency over a baseline pivot-based approach to zeroresource NMT on Spanish-French and GermanFrench translation tasks."

      "heading" : "2 Background",
      "text" : "Neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014) advocates the use of neural networks to model the translation process in an end-to-end manner. As a data-driven approach, NMT treats parallel corpora as the major source for acquiring translation knowledge.\nLet x be a source-language sentence and y be a target-language sentence. We use P (y|x;θx→y) to denote a source-to-target neural translation model, where θx→y is a set of model parame-\nters. Given a source-target parallel corpus Dx,y, which is a set of parallel source-target sentences, the model parameters can be learned by maximizing the log-likelihood of the parallel corpus:\nθ̂x→y = argmax θx→y { ∑ 〈x,y〉∈Dx,y logP (y|x;θx→y) }\nGiven learned model parameters θ̂x→y, the decision rule for finding the translation with the highest probability for a source sentence x is given by\nŷ = argmax y\n{ P (y|x; θ̂x→y) } (1)\nAs a data-driven approach, NMT heavily relies on the availability of large-scale parallel corpora to deliver state-of-the-art translation performance (Wu et al., 2016). Zoph et al. (2016) report that NMT obtains much lower BLEU scores than SMT if only small-scale parallel corpora are available. The heavy dependence on the quantity of training data poses a severe challenge for NMT to translation zero-resource language pairs.\nSimple and easy-to-implement, pivot-based methods have been widely used in SMT for translating zero-resource language pairs (De Gispert and Marino, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007;\nBertoldi et al., 2008; Wu and Wang, 2009; Zahabi et al., 2013; Kholy et al., 2013). As pivotbased methods are agnostic to model structures, they have been adapted to NMT recently (Cheng et al., 2016; Nakayama and Nishida, 2016b).\nFigure 1 illustrates the basic idea of pivot-based approaches to zero-resource NMT (Cheng et al., 2016; Nakayama and Nishida, 2016b). Let X, Y, and Z to denote source, target, and pivot languages. We use dashed lines to denote language pairs with parallel corpora available and solid lines with arrows to denote translation directions.\nIntuitively, the source-to-target translation can be indirectly modeled by bridging two NMT models via a pivot:\nP (y|x;θx→z,θz→y) = ∑ z P (z|x;θx→z)P (y|z;θz→y) (2)\nAs shown in Figure 1, the pivot-based approaches assume that the source-to-target parallel corpus Dx,z and the pivot-to-target parallel corpus Dz,y are available. As it is impractical to enumerate all possible pivot sentences, the two NMT models are trained separately in practice:\nθ̂x→z = argmax θx→z { ∑ 〈x,z〉∈Dx,z logP (z|x;θx→z) }\nθ̂z→y = argmax θz→y { ∑ 〈z,y〉∈Dz,y logP (y|z;θz→y) }\nDue to the exponential search space of pivot sentences, the decoding process of translating an unseen source sentence x has to be divided into two steps:\nẑ = argmax z\n{ P (z|x; θ̂x→z) } (3)\nŷ = argmax y\n{ P (y|ẑ; θ̂z→y) } (4)\nDespite its simplicity, the above two-step decoding process potentially suffers from the error propagation problem (Zhu et al., 2013): the translation errors made in the first step (i.e., source-topivot translation) will affect the second step (i.e., pivot-to-target translation).\nTherefore, it is necessary to explore methods for direct modeling of source-to-target translation without parallel corpora available."

The basic idea is to use a pre-trained pivot-to-target model (“teacher”) to guide the learning process of a source-to-target model without training data available (“student”) on a source-pivot parallel corpus.\nAs shown in Figure 1(b), we still assume that a source-to-pivot parallel corpus Dx,z and a pivot-to-source parallel corpus Dz,y are available. Unlike pivot-based approaches, we first use the pivot-to-target parallel corpus Dz,y to obtain a teacher model P (y|z; θ̂z→y), where θ̂z→y is a set of learned model parameters. Then, the teacher model “teaches” the student model P (y|x;θx→y) based on the following assumption. Assumption 1 If a source sentence x is a translation of a pivot sentence z, then the probability of generating a target sentence y from x should be close to that from its counterpart z.\nWe can move a further step to introduce a wordlevel assumption:\nAssumption 2 If a source word x is a translation of a pivot word z, then the probability of generating a target sentence y from x should be close to that from its counterpart z.\nThe two assumptions are empirically verified in our experiments (see Table 2). In the following subsections, we will introduce two approaches to zero-resource neural machine translation based on the two assumptions."

To address this problem, it is possible to construct a subspace by either sampling (Shen et al., 2016), generating a k-best list (Yong et al., 2016) or mode approximation (Kim and Rush, 2016). Then, standard stochastic gradient descent algorithms can be used to optimize model parameters."

The evaluation metric is case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as calculated by the multi-bleu.perl script. All the experiments treat English as the pivot language and French as the target language.\nFor the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005), we evaluate our proposed model on Spanish-French (Es-Fr) and Germany-French (De-Fr) translation tasks in a zero-resource scenario. To build nonoverlapping source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target datasets, we split pivot sentences shared by the original source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target corpora into two equal parts and merge them separately to the remaining source-to-pivot and pivotto-target corpora. Both the development and test datasets are from shared task 2006. All the sentences are tokenized by the tokenize.perl script. To deal with out-of-vocabulary words, we also adopt byte pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016) to split words into sub-words. The size of sub-words is set to 30K for each language.\nFor the WMT corpus, we evaluate our approach on a Spanish-French (Es-Fr) translation task with\na zero-resource setting. We combine the following corpora to form the Es-En and En-Fr parallel corpora: Common Crawl, News Commentary, Europarl v7 and UN. All the sentences are tokenized by the tokenize.perl script. Newstest2011 serves as the development set and newstest2012 and newstest2013 serve as test sets. We use case-sensitive BLEU to evaluate translation results. BPE is also used to reduce the vocabulary size. The size of sub-words is set to 43K, 33K, 43K for Spanish, English and French, respectively. See Table 1 for detailed statistics for both Europarl and WMT corpora.\nWe leverage a tutorial NMT open-source code implemented by Theano for all the experiments. 1 and compare our approach with state-of-the-art multilingual method (Firat et al., 2016b) and pivotbased method (Cheng et al., 2016) with the following variations:\n1. Sentence-Level Teaching: for simplicity, we use mode as suggested in (Kim and Rush, 2016) to approximate the target sentence space, which is the result of running beam search on the pivot sentences and taking the highest-scoring target sentence with the teacher model. Beam size with K = 1 (greedy decoding) and K = 5 are investigated in our paper, denoted as sent-greedy and sent-beam, respectively.\n2. Word-Level Teaching: we use the same mode approximation approach as in sentence-level teaching, denoted as word-greedy (beam search with K=1) and word-beam (beam search with K=5) respectively. Besides, Monte Carlo estimation by sampling from the\n1dl4mt-tutorial: https://github.com/nyu-dl\nteacher model is also investigated since it introduces more diverse data, denoted as wordsampling."

Then we use these two models to calculate JSENT and JWORD, which reveals how close the sentencelevel and word-level distributions are, respectively. Since it is difficult to measure JSENT and JWORD directly , we instead calculate their approximations as illustrated in Section 4.1. We report average KL divergence with different approximations evaluated on the aligned trilingual development set Exzy with 2000 sentences from shared task 2006 as shown in Table 1. We also report KL Divergence from a randomly initialized NMT model Prandom to pivot-to-target P (y|z,θz→y) for comparison.\nThe results agree with our assumptions since significantly smaller KL divergence is observed for KL ( P (y|z;θz→y)||P (y|x;θx→y) ) . For sentence-level distributions, smaller KL divergence for beam search approximation is observed compared with greedy approximation, indicating that mode produced by the beam search results of P (y|z;θz→y) have higher probabilities in P (y|x;θx→y) compared with the greedy results. Thus, we suspect that the sent-beam method will surpass the sent-greedy method. For word-level results, KL divergence of sampling approximation is the highest, indicating poorer performance than the other two methods. However, sampling methods introduce more data diversity at the target side. Thus it is harder to decide which factor dominates the training process. We leave further discussion to Section 4.3."

Besides that, our word-sampling method surprisingly obtains improvement over the likelihood method, which leverages source-to-target parallel corpus and also takes much longer to train.

However, as the time complexity grows linearly in the number of beams k, the better performance is achieved at the expense of beam search time.\nFor word-level experiments, we observe that word-sampling performs much better than the other two methods: 1.94 BLEU on es→ fr translation and 2.65 BLEU on de→ fr translation; 1.88 BLEU on es→ fr translation and 2.84 BLEU on de→ fr translation.

(2016b) propose an approach which genuinely delivers the multi-way, multilingual NMT model proposed by (Firat et al., 2016a) to zero-resource translation. They use the multi-way NMT model trained by other language pairs to generate pseudo parallel corpus and fine-tune the attention mechanism of the multi-way NMT model to enable zero-resource translation. Several authors propose a universal encoder-decoder network in multilingual scenarios to perform zero-shot learning. This universal model extracts translation knowledge from multiple different languages, making zero-resource translation feasible without directly training (Johnson et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016).\nBesides multilingual NMT, another import line of research is pivot-based methods. Inspired by the widely used pivot idea in SMT (De Gispert and Marino, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007; Bertoldi et al., 2008; Zahabi et al., 2013; Kholy et al., 2013), Cheng et al.(2016) propose pivotbased NMT by simultaneously improving source\nto pivot and pivot to target translation quality in order to improve source to target translation quality. Nakayama and Nishida (2016a) achieve zeroresource machine translation by utilizing image as pivot.\nIn (Kim and Rush, 2016), the author first introduce knowledge distilling in neural machine translation.
