      "text" : "Semantic role labeling (SRL) systems aim to recover the predicate-argument structure of a sentence, to determine essentially “who did what to whom”, “when”, and “where.” Recently breakthroughs involving end-to-end deep models for SRL without syntactic input (Zhou and Xu, 2015; Marcheggiani et al., 2017) seem to overturn the long-held belief that syntactic parsing is a prerequisite for this task (Punyakanok et al., 2008). In this paper, we show that this result can be pushed further using deep highway bidirectional LSTMs with constrained decoding, again significantly moving the state of the art (another 2 points on CoNLL 2005). We also present careful empirical analysis to determine what works well and what might be done to progress even further.\nOur model combines a number of best practices in the recent deep learning literature. Following Zhou and Xu (2015), we treat SRL as a BIO tagging problem and use deep bidirectional LSTMs. However, we differ by (1) simplifying the input and output layers, (2) introducing highway connections (Srivastava et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016), (3) using recurrent dropout (Gal, 2015), (4) decoding with BIO-constraints, and (5) ensembling with a product of experts. Our model gives a 10% relative error reduction over previous state of the art on the test sets of CoNLL 2005 and 2012. All code and models will be publicly released.\nWe present a set of detailed error analyses to better understand the performance gains, including (1) design choices on architecture, initialization, and regularization that have a surprisingly large impact on model performance, (2) analyses of different types of prediction errors, e.g. showing that deep models excel at predicting long-distance dependencies but still struggles with known challenges such as PP-attachment errors and adjunct-argument distinctions, (3) a careful analysis of the role of syntax, showing that there is significant room for improvement given oracle syntax but errors from existing parsers prevent effective use in SRL.\nIn summary, our main contributions are:\n• A new state-of-the-art deep network for endto-end SRL, supported by code and models that will be publicly available. • An in-depth error analysis indicating where\nthe models work well and where they still struggle, including discussion of structural consistency and long-distance dependencies. • Experiments that point toward directions for\nfuture improvements, including a detailed discussion of how and when syntactic parsers could be used to improve these results."

      "text" : "Two major factors contribute to the success of our deep SRL model: (1) applying recent advances in training deep recurrent neural networks such as highway connections (Srivastava et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016) and RNN-dropouts (Gal, 2015)1; and (2) using an A∗ decoding algorithm, similar to Lewis and Steedman (2014) to enforce structural consistency at prediction time, without adding more complexity to the training process.\nFormally, the goal of our task is to predict a sequence y given a sentence-predicate pair (w, v) as input. Each yi belongs to a discrete set of BIO tags T . Words outside argument spans have the tag O, and words at the beginning and inside of argument with role r have the tags Br and Ir respectively. Let n = |w| = |y| be the length of the sequence.\nPredicting an SRL structure under our model involves finding the highest-scoring tag sequence over the space of all possibilities Y:\nŷ = argmax y∈Y f(w,y) (1)\nWe use a deep bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to learn a locally decomposed scoring function conditioned on the input: ∑n t=1 log p(yt | w).\nTo incorporate additional information (e.g. structural consistency, syntactic input), we augment the scoring function with penalization terms:\nf(w,y) = n∑ t=1 log p(yt | w)− ∑ c∈C c(w, y1:t) (2)\nEach constraint function c applies a non-negative penalty given the input w and a length-t prefix y1:t. These constraints can be hard or soft depending on whether the penalties are finite."

(2016); Srivastava et al. (2015). We include transform gates rt to control the weight of linear and non-linear transformations between layers (See Figure 1). The output hl,t is changed to:\nrl,t = σ(W l r[hl,t−1,xt] + b l r) (12) h′l,t = ol,t ◦ tanh(cl,t) (13) hl,t = rl,t ◦ h′l,t + (1− rl,t) ◦Wlhxl,t (14)\nRecurrent Dropout To reduce over-fitting, we use dropout as described in Gal (2015).

To incorporate constraints on the output structure at decoding time, we use A∗ search over tag prefixes for decoding. Starting with an empty sequence, the tag sequence is built from left to right. The score for a partial sequence with length t is defined as:\nf(w, y1:t) = t∑ i=1 log p(yi | w)− ∑ c∈C c(w, y1:i)\n(17) An admissible A∗ heuristic can be computed efficiently by summing over the best possible tags for all timesteps after t:\ng(w, y1:t) = n∑ i=t+1 max yi∈T log p(yi | w) (18)\nExploration of the prefixes is determined by an agenda A which is sorted by f(w, y1:t) + g(w, y1:t). In the worst case, A∗ explores exponentially many prefixes, but because the distribution p(yt | w) learned by the BiLSTM models is very peaked, the algorithm is efficient in practice. We list some example constraints as follows:\nBIO Constraints These constraints reject any sequence that does not produce valid BIO transitions, such as BARG0 followed by IARG1.\nSRL Constraints Punyakanok et al. (2008); Täckström et al. (2015) described a list of SRLspecific global constraints: • Unique core roles (U): Each core role\n(ARG0-ARG5, ARGA) should appear at most once for each predicate. • Continuation roles (C): A continuation role\nC-X can exist only when its base role X is realized before it. • Reference roles (R): A reference role R-X\ncan exist only when its base role X is realized (not necessarily before R-X).\nWe only enforce U and C constraints, since the R constraints are more commonly violated in gold data, and enforcing them results in worse performance (see discussions in Section 4.3).\nSyntactic Constraints We can enforce consistency with a given parse tree by rejecting or penalizing arguments that are not constituents. In Section 4.4, we will discuss the motivation behind using syntactic constraints and experimental results using both predicted and gold syntax."

      "heading" : "4.1 Error Types Breakdown",
      "text" : "Inspired Kummerfeld et al. (2012), we define a set of oracle transformations that fix various prediction errors and observe the relative improvement after each operation (See Table 3). Figure 3 shows how our work compare to the previous systems in terms of different types of mistakes. The analysis shows that while our model makes a similar number of labeling errors to traditional syntax-based systems, it has far fewer missing arguments (perhaps due to parser errors making some arguments difficult to recover for syntax-based systems).\nLabel Confusion As shown in Table 3, our system most commonly makes labeling errors, where the predicted span is an argument but the role was incorrectly labeled. Table 4 shows a confusion matrix for the most frequent labels. The model often confuses ARG2 with AM-DIR, AM-LOC and AM-MNR. These confusions can arise due to the use of ARG2 in many verb frames to represent semantic relations such as direction or location. For example, ARG2 in the frame move.01 is defined as Arg2-GOL: destination 6. This type of argument-\n5Model predictions of CoNLL 2005 systems: http:// www.cs.upc.edu/˜srlconll/st05/st05.html\n6Source: Unified verb index: http://verbs. colorado.edu.\nadjunct distinction is known to be difficult (Kingsbury et al., 2002), and it is not surprising that our neural model has many such failure cases.\nAttachment Mistakes A second common source of error is reflected by the Merge Spans transformation (10.6%) and the Split Spans transformation (14.7%). These errors are closely tied to prepositional phrase (PP) attachment errors, which are also known to be some of the biggest challenges for linguistic analysis (Kummerfeld et al., 2012). Figure 4 shows the distribution of syntactic span labels involved in an attachment mistake, where 62% of the syntactic spans are prepositional phrases. For example, in Sumitomo financed the acquisition from Sears our model mistakenly labels the prepositional phrase from\nSears as the ARG2 of financed, whereas it should instead attach to acquisition."

      "text" : "To analyze the model’s ability to capture longrange dependencies, we compute the F1 of our model on arguments with various distances to the predicate. Figure 5 shows that for all models, performance tends to degrade for arguments further from the predicate. Interestingly, the gap between shallow and deep models becomes much larger for the long-distance predicate-argument structures. The absolute gap between our 2 layer and 8 layer models is 3-4 F1 for arguments that are within 2 words to the predicate, and 5-6 F1 for arguments that are farther away from the predicate. Surprisingly, the neural model performance deteriorates less severely on long-range dependencies than traditional syntax-based models."

      "heading" : "4.3 Structural Consistency",
      "text" : "We can quantify two types of structural consistencies: the BIO constraints and the SRL-specific constraints. Via our ablation study, we show that deeper BiLSTMs are better at enforcing these structural consistencies, although not perfectly.\nBIO Violations The BIO format requires argument spans to begin with a B tag. Any I tag directly following an O tag or a tag with different label is considered a violation. Table 5 shows the number of BIO violations per token for BiLSTMs with different depths. The number of BIO violations decreases when we use a deeper model. The gap is biggest between 2-layer and 4-layer models, and diminishes after that.\nIt is surprising that although the deeper models generate impressively accurate token-level predictions, they still make enough BIO errors to significantly hurt performance—when these constraints are simple enough to be enforced by trivial rules. To understand the reason behind it, we compare the average entropy between tokens involved BIO violations with the averaged entropy of all tokens. For the 8-layer model, the average entropy on these tokens is 30 times higher than the averaged entropy on all tokens. This suggests that BIO inconsistencies occur when there is some ambiguity. For example, if the model is unsure whether two consecutive words should belong to an ARG0 or ARG1, it might generate inconsistent BIO sequences such as BARG0, IARG1 when decoding at the token level. Using BIO-constrained decoding can resolve this ambiguity and result in a structurally consistent solution.\nSRL Structure Violations The model predictions can also violate the SRL-specific constraints commonly used in prior work (Punyakanok et al., 2008; Täckström et al., 2015). As shown in Table 6, the model occasionally violates these SRL constraints. With our constrained decoding algorithm, it is straightforward to enforce the unique core roles (U) and continuation roles (C) constraints during decoding. The constrained de-\ncoding results are shown with the model named L8+PoE+SRL in Table 6.\nAlthough the violations are eliminated, the performance does not significantly improve. This is mainly due to two factors: (1) the model often already satisfies these constraints on its own, so the number of violations to be fixed are relatively small, and (2) the gold SRL structure sometimes violate the constraints and enforcing hard constraints can hurt performance. Figure 6 shows a sentence in the CoNLL 2005 development set. Our original model produces two ARG2s for the predicate quicken, and this violates the SRL constraints. When the A∗ decoder fixes this violation, it changes the first ARG1 into ARG2 because ARG0,ARG1,ARG2 is a more frequent pattern in the training data and has higher overall score."

      "heading" : "4.4 Can Syntax Still Help SRL?",
      "text" : "The Propbank-style SRL formalism is closely tied to syntax (Bonial et al., 2010; Weischedel et al., 2011). In Table 6, we show that 98.7% of the gold SRL arguments match an unlabeled constituent in the gold syntax tree. Similar to some recent work (Zhou and Xu, 2015), our model achieved strong performance without directly modeling syntax. A natural question follows: are neural SRL models implicitly learning syntax? Table 6 shows the trend of deeper models making predictions that are more consistent with the gold syntax in terms of span boundaries. With our best model, 94.3% of the predicted arguments spans are part of the gold parse tree. This consistency is on par with previous CoNLL 2005 systems that directly model constituency and use predicted parse trees as features (Punyakanok, 95.3% and Pradhan, 93.0%).\nConstrained Decoding with Syntax The above analysis raises a further question: would improving consistency with syntax provide improvements for SRL? Our constrained decoding algorithm described in Section 2.2 enables us to inject syntax as a decoding constraint without having to re-train\nthe model. In Figure 7, we compare the SRL accuracy with syntactic constraints specified by gold parse or automatic parses. The penalty of disagreeing with the parse tree is a single parameter dictating how much the model should trust the provided syntax. When using gold syntax, the predictions improve up to 2 F1 as the penalty increases. The improvement from using Choe’s parser (Choe and Charniak, 2016) is much smaller, while using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) hurts performance if the model places too much trust in it. These results suggest that high-quality syntax can still make a large impact on SRL.\nA known challenge for syntactic parsers is robustness on out-of-domain data. Therefore we\nprovide experimental results in Table 7 for both CoNLL 2005 and CoNLL 2012, which consists of 8 different genres. The penalties are tuned on the two development sets separately (10000 on CoNLL 2005 and 20 on CoNLL 2012). On the CoNLL 2005 development set, the predicted syntax gives a 0.5 F1 improvement over our best model, while on in-domain test and outof-domain development sets, the improvement is much smaller. As expected, on CoNLL 2012, syntax improves most on the newswire (NW) domain. These improvements suggest that while decoding with hard constraints is beneficial, joint training or multi-task learning could be even more effective by leveraging full, labeled syntactic structures."

      "heading" : "5 Related Work",
      "text" : "Traditional approaches to semantic role labeling have used syntactic parsers to identify constituents and model long-range dependencies, and enforced global consistency using integer linear programming (Punyakanok et al., 2008) or dynamic programs (Täckström et al., 2015). More recently, neural methods have been employed on top of syntactic features (FitzGerald et al., 2015; Roth and Lapata, 2016). Our experiments show that off-\nthe-shelf neural methods have a remarkable ability to learn long-range dependencies, syntactic constituency structure, and global constraints without coding task-specific mechanisms for doing so.\nAn alternative line of work has attempted to reduce the dependency on syntactic input for semantic role labeling models. Collobert et al. (2011) first introduced an end-to-end neural-based approach with sequence-level training and uses a convolutional neural network to model the context window. However, their best system fell short of traditional feature-based systems. Neural methods have also been used as classifiers in transition-based SRL systems (Henderson et al., 2013; Swayamdipta et al., 2016). Most recently, several successful LSTM-based architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results in English span-based SRL (Zhou and Xu, 2015), Chinese SRL (Wang et al., 2015) and dependencybased SRL (Marcheggiani et al., 2017), with little to no syntactic input. Our techniques push results to more than 3 F1 over the best syntax-based models. However, we also show that there is potential for syntax to further improve performance."

Our ensemble of 8 layer BiLSTMs incorporated some of the recent best practices such as orthonormal initialization, RNN-dropout, and highway connections, and we have shown that they are crucial for getting good results with deep models.\nExtensive error analysis sheds light on the strengths and limitations of our deep SRL model, with detailed comparison against shallower models and two strong non-neural systems. While our deep model is better at recovering longdistance predicate-argument relations, we still observe structural inconsistencies, which can be alleviated by constrained A∗ decoding.\nFinally, we posed the question of whether deep SRL still needs syntactic supervision. Despite recent success without syntactic input, we found that our best neural model can still benefit from accurate syntactic parser output via straightforward constrained decoding. Our oracle experiment, where the SRL system receives a 3 F1 gain from gold syntax showed potential for syntax to further improve deep SRL models."

Our 8-layer ensemble model achieves 83.2 F1 on the CoNLL 2005 test set and 83.4 F1 on CoNLL 2012, roughly a 10% relative error reduction over the previous state of the art. Extensive empirical analysis of these gains show that (1) deep models excel at recovering long-distance dependencies but can still make surprisingly obvious errors, and (2) that there is still room for syntactic parsers to improve these results.
