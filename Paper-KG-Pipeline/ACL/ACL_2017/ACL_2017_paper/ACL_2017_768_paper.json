      "text" : "Many NLP applications require detecting relations between word meanings beyond synonymy and paraphrasing. For instance, given “Carlsen plays chess.” and the question “Which game does Carlsen play?”, successfully answering the question requires knowing that chess is a kind of game, or more generally, that chess entails game.\nWhile prior work has defined lexical entailment as a relation between word types (Turney and Mohammad, 2013), we argue entailment relations are better defined when illustrating word meaning with an example in context. Ignoring context is problematic since entailment might hold between some senses of the words, but not others. Consider the word game in two distinct contexts:\n1. The championship game was played in NYC.\n2. The hunters were interested in the big game.\nGiven the sentence, Carlsen is the world chess champion, chess =⇒ game as used in the first context, while chess 6=⇒ game in the second context.\nIn this paper, we investigate how to represent and compare the meaning of words in context for lexical entailment. Since distributional representations for word types have proved useful to detect lexical entailment out of context in supervised settings (Baroni et al., 2012; Roller et al., 2014; Turney and Mohammad, 2013), we propose to transform context-agnostic word type representations into contextualized representations that highlight salient properties of the context (Section 3), and use these contextualized representations with a range of semantic similarity features (Section 4) to successfully detect entailment.\nAs we will see, these context representations significantly improve performance over contextagnostic baselines not only in English, but also between English and French words (Section 7) on two novel datasets (Section 5). We also show that our features are sensitive to word sense changes indicated by context, and adequately capture the direction of entailment relation (Section 8). Moreover, we establish a new state-of-the-art on an existing dataset that captures a broader range of semantic relations in context (Shwartz and Dagan, 2015), and show that the proposed features, induced solely from large amounts of raw text, yield systems that perform as well, or better than existing systems that require additional human annotation."

      "text" : "We frame the task of lexical entailment in context as a binary classification task on examples consisting of a 4-tuple (wl, wr, cl, cr), where wl and wr are two words, and cl and cr are sentences which\nillustrate each word usage. The example is treated as positive if wl =⇒ wr, given the meaning of each word exemplified by the contexts, and negative otherwise. Table 1 provides examples.\nWe say that entailment holds if the meaning of wl in the context of cl is more specific than the meaning of wr in the context of cr. The nature of entailment relations captured out-of-context can be broader depending on the test beds considered1. Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan (2009) formalize lexical entailment as a substitutional relationship, which encompasses synonymy, hypernymy, some meronymy relations, and also cause-effect relations. However, we limit entailment to the specificity relation in this work to better understand the impact of context.\nNote that lexical entailment in context is not textual entailment. Recognizing textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2013) and natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015) involves detecting entailment relations between sentences, while lexical entailment is a relation between words."

(2011); Erk and Padó (2008), our first approach is to apply a filter to word type representations to highlight the salient dimensions of the exemplar context, emphasizing relevant dimensions of and downplaying unimportant ones. However, while prior work represents context by averaging word vectors, we propose richer representations that better capture the salient geometrical properties of the exemplar context that might get lost by averaging (Figure 1).\nFirst, we construct fixed length representations for the contexts cl and cr by running convolutional filters over Cl and Cr. Specifically, we calculate the column-wise maximum, minimum and the mean over the matrices Cl and Cr, as done by (Tang et al., 2014) for supervised sentiment classification. This yields three ddimensional vectors for cl (~cl,max, ~cl,min, ~cl,mean), and three d-dimensional vectors for cr (~cr,max, ~cr,min, ~cr,mean). Computing the maximum and minimum across all vector dimensions captures the exterior surface of the “instance manifold”\n(the volume in embedding space within which all words in the instance reside), while the mean summarizes the density per-dimension within the manifold (Hovy, 2015).\nSecond, we transform initial context-agnostic representations for target word types by taking an element-wise product of the word type vectors ( ~w∗) with vectors representing salient dimensions of the exemplar context (~c∗,max, ~c∗,min, ~c∗,mean) where ∗ ∈ {l, r} . This yields three d-dimensional vectors for wl (~wl,max, ~wl,min, ~wl,mean), and three for wr (~wr,max, ~wr,min, ~wr,mean). We refer to our final word-in-context representations for wl and wr as ~wl,mask and ~wr,mask respectively, where ~wl,mask is the concatenation of ~wl,max, ~wl,min, ~wl,mean, and ~wr,mask is also similarly constructed."

In a single language, this can be done using Context2Vec (Melamud et al., 2016), a neural model that, given a target word and its sentential context, embeds both the word and the context in the same low-dimensional space, with the objective of having the context predict the target word via a log linear model. This model approaches the state-of-the-art on lexical substitution, sentence completion, and supervised word sense disambiguation."

We follow the same practice with our context-aware word representations. Intuitively, the classifier learns to weight the importance of each dimension of a word representation to detect\nentailment.

The cosine similarity captures the difference in the two vectors in terms of the angle between then, the euclidean distance measures the difference in magnitude, and the dot product captures both magnitude and angle.\nWe apply these measures to three types of representations. Our first set of similarities is intended to directly capture the similarities between contextualized word representations (Section 3.1). We calculate pairwise similarities between (~wl,max, ~wr,max), (~wl,min, ~wr,min), (~wl,mean, ~wr,mean), as well as between the context-agnostic representations (~wl, ~wr). Second, we add similarities based on Context2Vec representations, i.e. between each pair of ~wl,c2v, ~wr,c2v, ~cl,c2v, and ~cr,c2v. Finally, following Shwartz and Dagan (2015), we capture the similarity of the most relevant word to wl in cr, that to wr in cl, as well as between cl and cr.

These word pairs are semiautomatically labeled with semantic relations outof-context. Shwartz and Dagan (2015) augmented them with examples of word usage in context, and re-annotating word pairs given the extra contextual information. The final dataset consists of 3750 words/contexts tuples with a corresponding label from Table 2, one of which is entailment."

      "heading" : "5.2 CONTEXT-WN",
      "text" : "In addition to CONTEXT-PPDB, we would like a test set for controlled analysis of lexical entailment in context. We would like to directly assess the sensitivity of our models to contexts that signal different word senses, as well as quantify the extent to which our models detect asymmetric entailment relations rather than semantic similarity.\nBased on the above criteria, we introduce a large-scale dataset automatically extracted from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998a). We call this dataset CONTEXT-WN. WordNet groups synonyms into synsets. Most synsets are further accompanied by one or more short sentences illustrating the use of the members of the synset. The idea behind CONTEXT-WN is to use these example sentences as context for the words, and hypernymy relations to draw examples of lexical entailment relations. The entire process starts from a seed list of words W and proceeds as follows (see Figure 2 for an illustration) :\n1. For each word type w ∈ W with multiple synsets, obtain all synsets Sw.\n2. For each synset i ∈ Sw, pick a hypernym synset sih, with a corresponding word form wih. Also obtain c\ni and cih which are example sentences corresponding to wi and wih respectively - (wi, wih, c\ni, cih) serves as a positive example.\n3. Permute the positive examples to get negative examples. From (wi, wih, c\ni, cih) and (wj , wjh, c\nj , cjh), generate negative examples (wi, wjh, c i, cjh) and (w j , wih, c j , cih).\n4. Flip the positive examples to generate more negative examples. From (wi, wih, c\ni, cih) generate the negative example (wih, w i, cih, c i).\nWe run this process using the 9000 most frequent words from Wikipedia as W (after filtering the top 1000 as stopwords). This yields a total of 5239 positive examples. We sample an equal number of negative examples from Step 3, with another 5239 examples being generated in Step 4. The final dataset consists of 10478 negative examples.\nCONTEXT-WN satisfies our desiderata. The dataset has a very specific focus since we only pick hypernym-hyponym pairs. The negative examples generated in Steps 3 and 4 require discriminating between different word senses and entailment directions. Finally, with over 15000 examples distributed over 6000 word pairs, the dataset is almost five times as large as CONTEXT-PPDB.\nWe use a 70/5/25 train/dev/test split as in CONTEXT-PPDB. We also ensure that each set contains different word pairs, to avoid memorization and overfitting (Levy et al., 2015)."

To create this dataset, we follow the same methodology that was used to create CONTEXT-PPDB, replacing word pairs from PPDB with a set of 100 English-French\nword pairs labeled as positive out-of-context in the cross-lingual lexical entailment dataset of Vyas and Carpuat (2016). Each word pair (wl, wr) consists of an English word and a French word. To add context, we extract 10 sentence pairs (cl, cr) per word pair from the Wikipedia in the corresponding language. These thousand examples are then given to annotators on a crowdsourcing platform 2. For each example (wl, wr, cl, cr), the annotators were asked to judge whether wl =⇒ wr given the contexts cl and cr. Each example was annotated by 5 workers3.\nFor each example, we assign the majority judgment as the correct label. 4 or more annotators agree on the label on 540 examples, and we retain only these examples as our test set.

We analyze the predictions made on this subset by our model using a metric we call ‘Macro-F1’, defined as the weighted F1 calculated over each (wl,wr) word pair, and then averaged over all word pairs.\nModels using context-aware features do consistently better on Macro-F1 than those without (Table 4).

      "text" : "WordNet and lexical entailment The is-a hierarchy of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998b) is a prominent source of information for unsupervised detection of hypernymy and entailment (Harabagiu\nand Moldovan, 1998; Shwartz et al., 2015), as well as a source of various datasets (Baroni and Lenci, 2011; Baroni et al., 2012). The dataset we introduce in this work is inspired by the latter line of work, but instead of just extracting word pairs we also obtain exemplar contexts from WordNet.\nModeling word meaning in context Several approaches have been proposed to model the meaning of a word in a given context to capture semantic equivalence in tasks such as lexical substitution, word sense disambiguation or paraphrase ranking (but not entailment).\nOne line of work (Dinu and Lapata, 2010; Reisinger and Mooney, 2010) treats each word as a set of latent word senses. These models methods start with token representations for individual occurrences of a word and then choose a set of token vectors based on the current context. An alternate set of models (Erk and Padó, 2008; Thater et al., 2011; Dinu et al., 2012) avoids defining a fixed set of word senses, and instead contextualizes word type vectors as we do in this paper. These models share the idea of using an element-wise multiplication to apply a context mask to word type representations. The nature of the context representation varies: Erk and Pado (2008) use inverse selectional preferences; Thater et al (2010) combine a first order representation for the context with a second order representation for the target, Thater et al. (2011) rely on syntactic dependencies to define context. Apidianaki (2016) shows that bag-ofword context representation within a small context window works as well as syntactic definitions of context for ranking paraphrases in context.\nThe use of convolution is motivated by success of similar models on sentence classification tasks. Tang et al (2014) uses convolution over embedding matrices for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, while Hovy (2015) uses just unigrams. However, all these works only use convolved representations\nto predict properties of the sentence (e.g., sentiment). We use them, instead, to contextualize our target word representations.\nIn-context lexical semantic tasks Besides entailment, other lexical semantic tasks studied in the presence of context include lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), cross-lingual lexical substitution (Mihalcea et al., 2010) and paraphrase ranking (Apidianaki, 2016). The last work is also notable because of their successful use of models of word-meaning in context from Thater et al (2011), which is closely related to our methods."

We show that contextualized word representations constructed by transforming contextagnostic representations, combined with wordcontext similarity features, lead to large improvements over context-agnostic model, not only in English, but also between English and French words on two novel datasets. We also improve the state-of-the-art on a related task of detecting semantic relations in context. Our features are sensitive to changes in entailment based on context, and also capture the directionality of entailment.\nIn future work, we aim to further improve performance on both monolingual and cross-lingual datasets. We anticipate that richer features, capturing second-order comparisons used to detect lexical contrast (Mohammad et al., 2013) and entailment out of context (Turney and Mohammad, 2013), might be useful for this purpose, perhaps in combination with non-linear classifiers. Given the usefulness of similarities, we also plan to investigate asymmetric scoring functions(Kotlerman et al., 2010; Shwartz et al., 2017)."

We show that contextualized word representations constructed from existing word embeddings, and word-context similarity features lead to significant improvements over context-agnostic models on two novel entailment test sets, and also improve the state-of-the-art on the related task of detecting semantic relations in context (Shwartz and Dagan, 2015).",
