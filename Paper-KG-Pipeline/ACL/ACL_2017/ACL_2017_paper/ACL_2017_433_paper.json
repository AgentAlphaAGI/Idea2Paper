      "text" : "Languages evolve temporally and geographically, both in vocabulary as well as in syntactic structures. When major languages such as English or French are adopted in another culture as the primary language, they often mix with existing languages or dialects in that culture and evolve into a stable language called a creole. Examples of creoles include the French-based Haitian Creole, and Colloquial Singaporean English (Singlish) (MianLian and Platt, 1993), an English-based creole. While the majority of the natural language processing (NLP) research attention has been focused on the major languages, little work has been done on adapting the components to creoles. One notable body of work originated from the featured translation task of the EMNLP 2011 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT11) to translate Haitian Creole SMS messages sent during the 2010 Haitian earthquake. This work high-\nlights the importance of NLP tools on creoles in crisis situations for emergency relief (Hu et al., 2011; Hewavitharana et al., 2011).\nSinglish is one of the major languages in Singapore, with borrowed vocabulary and grammars from a number of languages including Malay, Tamil, and Chinese dialects such as Hokkien, Cantonese and Teochew (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011), and it has been increasingly used in written forms on web media. Fluent English speakers unfamiliar with Singlish would find the creole hard to comprehend (Harada, 2009). Correspondingly, fundamental English NLP components such as POS taggers and dependency parsers perform poorly on such Singlish texts based on our observations. For example, Seah et al. (2015) adapted the Socher et al. (2013) sentiment analysis engine to the Singlish vocabulary, but failed to adapt the parser. Since dependency parsers are important for tasks such as information extraction (Miwa and Bansal, 2016) and discourse parsing (Li et al., 2015), this hinders the development of such downstream applications for Singlish in written forms and thus makes it crucial to build a dependency parser that can perform well natively on Singlish.\nTo address this issue, we start with investigating the linguistic characteristics of Singlish and specifically the causes of difficulties for understanding Singlish with English syntax. We found that, despite the obvious attribute of inheriting a large portion of basic vocabularies and grammars from English, Singlish not only imports terms from regional languages and dialects, its lexical semantics and syntax also deviate significantly from English (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011). We categorize the challenges and formalize their interpretation using Universal Dependencies (Nivre et al., 2016), which extends to the creation of a Singlish dependency treebank with 1,200 sentences.\nBased on the intricate relationship between\nSinglish and English, we build a Singlish parser by leveraging knowledge of English syntax as a basis. This overall approach is illustrated in Figure 1. In particular, we train a basic Singlish parser with the best off-the-shelf neural dependency parsing model using biaffine attention (Dozat and Manning, 2016), and improve it with knowledge transfer by adopting neural stacking (Chen et al., 2016; Zhang and Weiss, 2016) to integrate the English syntax. Since POS tags are important features for dependency parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014; Dyer et al., 2015), we train a POS tagger for Singlish following the same idea by integrating English POS knowledge using neural stacking (Chen et al., 2016; Zhang and Weiss, 2016).\nResults show that English syntax knowledge brings 31.58% and 36.51% relative error reduction on POS tagging and dependency parsing respectively, resulting in a Singlish dependency parser with 84.21% unlabeled attachment score (UAS).\nWe make our Singlish dependency treebank, the source code for training a dependency parser and the trained model for the parser with the best performance freely available online1."

      "text" : "Neural networks have led to significant advance in the performance for dependency parsing, including transition-based parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014; Zhou et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2015; Dyer et al., 2015; Ballesteros et al., 2015; Andor et al., 2016), and graph-based parsing (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016; Dozat and Manning, 2016). In particular, the biaffine attention method of Dozat and Manning (2016) uses deep bi-directional long\n1https://github.com/ANONYMIZED/ ANONYMIZED\nshort-term memory (bi-LSTM) networks for highorder non-linear feature extraction, producing the state-of-the-art performance for English dependency parsing. We adopt this model as the basis for our Singlish parser.\nOur work belongs to a line of work on transfer learning for parsing, which leverages English resources in Universal Dependencies to improve the parsing accuracies of low-resource languages (Hwa et al., 2005; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Ganchev et al., 2009). Seminal work employed statistical models. McDonald et al. (2011) investigated delexicalized transfer, where word-based features are removed from a statistical model for English, so that POS and dependency label knowledge can be utilized for training a model for lowresource language. Subsequent work considered syntactic similarities between languages for better feature transfer (Täckström et al., 2012; Naseem et al., 2012; Zhang and Barzilay, 2015).\nRecently, a line of work leverages neural network models for multi-lingual parsing (Guo et al., 2015; Duong et al., 2015; Ammar et al., 2016). The basic idea is to map the word embedding spaces between different languages into the same vector space, by using sentence-aligned bilingual data. This gives consistency in tokens, POS and dependency labels thanks to the availability of Universal Dependencies (Nivre et al., 2016). Our work is similar to these methods in using a neural network model for knowledge sharing between different languages. However, ours is different in the use of a neural stacking model, which respects the distributional differences between Singlish and English words. This empirically gives higher accuracies for Singlish."

      "text" : "Since English is the major genesis of Singlish, we choose English as the source of lexical feature transfer to assist Singlish dependency parsing. Universal Dependencies provides a set of multilingual treebanks with cross-lingually consistent dependency-based lexicalist annotations, designed to aid development and evaluation for cross-lingual systems, such as multilingual parsers (Nivre et al., 2016). The current version of Universal Dependencies comprises not only major treebanks for 47 languages but also their siblings for domain-specific corpora and di-\nalects. With the aligned initiatives for creating transfer-learning-friendly treebanks, we adopt the Universal Dependencies protocol for constructing the Singlish dependency treebank, both as a new resource for the low-resource languages and to facilitate knowledge transfer from English.\nOn top of the general Universal Dependencies guidelines, English-specific dependency relation definitions including additional subtypes are employed as the default standards for annotating the Singlish dependency treebank, unless augmented or redefined when necessary. The latest English corpus in Universal Dependencies v1.42 collection is constructed from the English Web Treebank (Bies et al., 2012), comprising of web media texts, which potentially smooths the knowledge transfer to our target Singlish texts in similar domains. The statistics of this dataset, from which we obtain English syntactic knowledge, is shown in Table 1 and we refer to this corpus as UD-Eng. This corpus uses 47 dependency relations and we show below how to conform to the same standard while adapting to unique Singlish grammars."

      "heading" : "3.2 Challenges and Solutions for Annotating Singlish",
      "text" : "The deviations of Singlish from English come from both the lexical and the grammatical levels (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011), which bring challenges for analysis on Singlish using English NLP tools. The former involves imported vocabularies from the first languages of the local people and the latter can be represented by a set of relatively localized features which collectively form 5 unique grammars of Singlish according to Leimgruber (2011). We find empirically that all these deviations can be accommodated by applying the existing English dependency relation definitions, which are explained with examples as follows.\nImported vocabulary: Singlish borrows a number of words and expressions from its nonEnglish origins (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011), such as “Kiasu”, which originates from Hokkien meaning “very anxious not to miss an opportunity”.3 These imported terms often constitute out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with respect to a standard English treebank and result in difficulties for using English-trained tools on Singlish. All borrowed words are annotated according to their original\n2Only guidelines for Universal Dependencies v2 but not the English corpus is available when this work is completed.\n3Definition by the Oxford living Dictionaries for English.\nmeanings using existing UD-Eng POS tags and dependency relations. Table A3 in Appendix A summarizes all borrowed terms in our treebank.\nTopic-prominence: This type of sentences start with establishing its topic, which often serves as the default one that the rest of the sentence refers to, and they typically employ an object-subjectverb sentence structure (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011). In particular, three subtypes of topic-prominence are observed in the Singlish dependency treebank and their annotations are addressed as follows:\nFirst, topics framed as clausal arguments at the beginning of the sentence are labeled as “csubj” (clausal subject), as shown by “Drive this car” of (1) in Figure 2. This type can be regarded as a variant of the English it-extraposition sentence structure with the extraposition moved to the front and the clause marker removed.\nSecond, noun phrases used to modify the predicate with the presence of a preposition is regarded as a “nsubj” (nominal subject). This is a common order of words used in Chinese and one example is the “SG” of (2) in Figure 2.\nThird, prepositional phrases moved in front are\nstill treated as “nmod” (nominal modifier) of their intended heads, following the exact definition but as a Singlish-specific form of exemplification, as shown by the “Inside tent” of (3) in Figure 2.\nCopula deletion: Imported from the corresponding Chinese sentence structure, this copula verb is often optional and deleted in Singlish, which is one of its diagnostic characteristics (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011). In UD-Eng standards, predicative “be” is the only verb used as a copula, which often depends on its complement to avoid copular head. Thus the deleted copula and its “cop” (copula) arc are simply ignored to preserve the intactness of the dependency tree, as shown by (4) in Figure 2. The only possibility of a copular root is when the copula has a clausal argument or adjunct. However, such copula is typically not deleted in either Singlish or Chinese, and we have not encountered such cases in our treebank. If they appear by any chance, feasible solutions can be either recovering the copula with a special symbol or promoting the head of the clausal argument or adjunct as the sentence root.\nNP deletion: Noun-phrase (NP) deletion often results in null subjects or objects. It may be regarded as a branch of “Topic-prominence” but is a distinctive feature of Singlish with relatively high frequency of usage (Leimgruber, 2011). Again, we do not recover such relations since the deleted NP imposes negligible alteration to the dependency tree, as exemplified by (5) in Figure 2.\nInversion: Inversion in Singlish involves either reversed order of subject and verb in interrogative sentences, or tag questions in polar interrogatives (Leimgruber, 2011). The former simply involves a change of word orders and thus requires no special treatments. On the other hand, tag questions should be carefully analyzed in two scenarios. One type is in the form of “isn’t it ?” or “haven’t you ?”, which are dependents of the sentence root with the “parataxis” relation.4 The other type is exemplified as “right ?”, and its Singlish equivalent “tio boh ?” (a transliteration from Hokkien) are labeled with the “discourse” (discourse element) relation with respect to the sentence root. See example (6) in Figure 2.\nDiscourse particles: Usage of clausal-final discourse particles, which originates from Hokkien\n4Relation between the main verb of a clause and other sentential elements, such as sentential parenthetical clause, or adjacent sentences without any explicit coordination or subordination.\nand Cantonese, is one of the most typical feature of Singlish (Leimgruber, 2009, 2011; Lim, 2007). All discourse particles that appear in our treebank are summarized in Table A3 in Appendix A with the imported vocabulary:. These words express the tone of the sentence and thus have the “INTJ” (interjection) POS tag and depend on the root of the sentence or clause labeled with “discourse”, as is shown by the “leh” of (3) in Figure 2. The word “one” is a special instance of this type with the sole purpose being a tone marker in Singlish but not English, as shown by (7) in Figure 2."

However, due to limited amount of training data, the tagging accuracy is not satisfactory even with a large dropout rate to avoid overfitting. In contrast, the neural stacking structure on top of the English base model trained on UD-Eng achieves a POS tagging accuracy of 84.79%14, which corresponds to a 31.58% relative error reduction over the baseline Singlish model, as shown in Table 2.

The number of sentences and the results in each group of the test set are shown in Table 5.\nThe neural stacking model leads to the biggest improvement over nearly all categories except for a slightly lower yet competitive performance on “NP Deletion” cases, which explains the significant overall improvement.\n17Multiple labels are allowed for one sentence. 18The “Inversion” type of grammar is not analyzed since\nthere is only 1 such sentence in the test set.\nComparing the base model with ICE-SIN embeddings with the base parser trained on UD-Eng, which contain syntactic and semantic knowledge in Singlish and English, respectively, the former outperforms the latter on all 4 types of Singlish grammars but not for the remaining samples. This suggests that the base English parser mainly contributes to analyzing basic English syntax, while the Singlish dependency treebank models unique Singlish grammars better.\nUsing the English Giga100M embeddings in the base model only helps to improve parsing for “Topic Prominence” and “Copula Deletion” compared to the Singlish ICE-SIN embeddings. The main reason can be that these two types of grammars preserve a high percentage of English syntax, with only alterations in word orders and deletions of one word. However, “NP Deletion” results in more radical sentence incompleteness and “Discourse Particles” are unique in Singlish. An interesting finding is that feeding English distributed lexical semantic information to the base Singlish parser undermines the performance even over basic English syntax, which again suggests the differences in distributed lexical semantics."

Results show that English knowledge can lead to 36% relative error reduction, resulting in a parser of around 85% accuracies. We make both our annotation and parser available for further research.",
