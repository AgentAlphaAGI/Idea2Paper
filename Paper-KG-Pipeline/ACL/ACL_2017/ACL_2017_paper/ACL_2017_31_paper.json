      "text" : "Event factuality is the information expressing the commitment of relevant sources towards the factual nature of events. That is, event factuality conveys whether an event is characterized as a fact, a certain possibility, or an impossible situation, and thus is helpful for various NLP applications, e.g., opinion detection (Wiebe et al., 2005), QA (Pustejovsky et al., 2005), textual entailment (de Marneffe et al., 2006; Hickl and Bensley, 2007), rumor identification (Qazvinian et al., 2011).\nIn principle, the value of event factuality is related to some elements, e.g., predicates, speculative and negative cues. Consider following sentences as examples1:\n(S1) McCulley, a famous economist, doubts that the tax rate will increase soon.\n(S2) He knows they are not able to go to the village due to the flood.\nIn sentence S1, the event increase is a possibility according to the predicate doubts, while in\n1In this paper, events are in bold and sources are underlined in example sentences.\nS2, the event go is regarded as an impossible situation due to the negation word not. From these sentences, we can learn that predicates and cues can determine the event factuality to a great degree. Such event factuality provides the way to distinguish fact events from speculative and negative ones.\nTraditional methods for event factuality identification usually employed either hand-crafted rules (Saurı́, 2008; Saurı́ and Pustejovsky, 2012) relying on expert knowledge, or features (Prabhakaran et al., 2010; de Marneffe et al., 2012) relying on various kinds of annotated information, such as source introducing predicates, predicate classes, speculative and negative cues. Due to the recent success of deep learning on various NLP tasks in learning useful representations from ordinary sentences (Socher et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2016) and syntactic paths (Xu et al., 2015a,b; Roth and Lapata, 2016) and the attention mechanism on capturing the focus change in sequence modeling (Chen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016), this paper proposes a framework to identify event factuality in raw texts with neural networks. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1) the proposal of a two-step supervised framework for identifying event factuality in raw texts.\n2) the utilization of an attention-based CNN to detect source introducing predicates (SIPs), the most important factors to identify event factuality.\n3) the proposal of an attention-based deep neural network model with a proper combination of BiLSTM and CNN to identify the factuality of events."

      "text" : "Factuality can be characterized by the combination of two dimensions: epistemic modality and polarity (Saurı́, 2008). While modality conveys the certainty degree of events, such as certain (CT), probable (PR), possible (PS) and underspecified (U), polarity expresses whether the event happened, including positive (+), negative (-) and underspecified (u). Table 1 shows various values of event factuality. For example, CT+ means it is certain that the event happened, while PR- denotes it is probable that the event did not happen. Notice that some values are non-application (NA) grammatically, e.g., PRu, PSu, U+/-."

      "text" : "Considering that FactBank is built on top of TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b), we adopt the definition of events proposed by TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a) from a more grammatical and generalized perspective. We consider the events which can be critical for computing the factuality. Such events can be detected by feature-based methods (Chambers, 2013).\nIn the literature, three kinds of factors play critical roles in event factuality identification: Source Introducing Predicate (SIP), source and cue.\nSIP. Source Introducing Predicates (SIPs) are events that can not only introduce additional sources to assess the factuality of embedded events, but also influence their factuality. For example, the SIP doubts introduces McCulley as a new source in S1, and McCulley evaluates event increase as a possibility according to doubts.\nSource. By default, AUTHOR is considered the only source if the sentence contains no SIPs. Further sources can be incorporated by SIPs. In S1, the event increase has two sources: AUTHOR and McCulley. The factuality value is not the inherent property of the event but always relevant to the sources. McCulley commits to the event increase as a possibility, while AUTHOR remains uncommitted. Strictly speaking, we as readers know about McCulley’s perspective only accord-\ning to AUTHOR. Hence, we appeal to the notion of the nested source structure (Wiebe et al., 2005) and represent the sources in the chain form: McCulley AUTHOR, which means McCulley is Embedded in AUTHOR. Only AUTHOR can be displayed by a simple source.\nCues are words that have speculative or negative meanings. The modality of a Non-Uu event is PR/PS if this event is modified by a PR/PS cue, while the polarity of a Non-Uu event is negative if this event is modified by a negative (NEG) cue. So cues are key signals to identify the event factuality. For instance, the factuality of event go in S1 is CT- due to the NEG cue not."

      "text" : "For event detection task, we only consider nouns, verbs, adjectives as the candidate tokens to reduce the complexity, and we utilize a maximum entropy classification model with the features used by Chambers (2013).\nØvrelid et al. (2010) and Velldal et al. (2012) concluded that syntactic features are not necessary and lexical sequence-oriented n-gram features can achieve excellent performances on cue detection\ntask. Hence, we employ the lexical features developed by Velldal et al. (2012) to classify each token into PR cue, PS cue, Neg cue, or not cue."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.2 SIP Detection",
      "text" : "Whether an event is a SIP has relation to its semantic information. For instance, verbs state, say, tell are usually used to express opinions which are promoted by certain participants of events, so they can all introduce additional sources. Therefore, they are in the same synonym set {state, say, tell} and share the same hypernym in WordNet2. Hence, we consider token, part-of-speech (POS) and hypernym of the token as lexical level features, and concatenate them into the vector l.\nAccording to the definition of SIPs, if there is no event in the syntactic scope of a word, this word is not a SIP. For example:\n(S3) Tom suggests we should have a rest now. In S3, although the event suggests can introduce a new source Tom for the clause “we should have a rest now”, however, this clause expresses a suggestion and is not an event. So the event suggests is NOT a SIP in S3. This example demonstrates the structure of a sentence is also able to determine whether a token is a SIP. Therefore, we also consider the sentence level feature. Instead of original sentences, we propose the following Pruned Sentence structure:\nPruned Sentence (PSen): If a clause of the candidate token contains events, this clause is replaced by the tag 〈event〉; Nouns, pronouns and the current candidate token are unchanged, while other tokens are replaced by the tag 〈O〉.\nWe argue that PSen can characterize clearly whether there are events in the clause of the token. Besides, in PSen only the candidate token and the tokens that are possible to be new sources are reserved, and effects of other tokens are omitted.\nFor example, in S4, the current candidate event says governs the clause “the manager will attend a meeting later”, which contains the event attend. Hence this clause is replaced by the tag 〈event〉. While the tokens which are impossible to be new sources are replaced by 〈O〉. Sentence S5 is the PSen structure of S4.\n(S4) Tom, who is the secretary of the manager, says the manager will attend a meeting later .\n(S5) Tom 〈O〉 who 〈O〉 〈O〉 secretary 〈O〉 〈O〉 manager 〈O〉 says 〈event〉 〈O〉\n2http://wordnet.princeton.edu\nConsidering that PSen is a simplified and pruned structure, we extract sentence level features through an attention-based CNN illustrated in Figure 2 instead of RNN model. A pruned sentence S = (t0, t1, . . . , tn−1) is transferred to a matrix X0 ∈ Rd0×n according to pre-trained word embeddings. Our CNN is computed as follows:\nY1 =WcX0 + bc (1)\nYm = tanh (Y1) (2)\nα = softmax(vTc Ym) (3) c = tanh (Y1α T ) (4)\nwhere Wc ∈ Rnc×d0 , bc,vc, c ∈ Rnc . The lexical feature l includes the embeddings of the token, the POS tag and the hypernym with the dimension of d0, dpos and dhyp, respectively. We concatenate c and l into f0 = [lT , cT ]T for each token. Finally, f0 is fed into the softmax layer:\no = softmax(Ws0f0 + bs0) (5)\nwhere o ∈ R2. To train the network, we exploit the following objective function:\nJ(θ) = − 1 m m−1∑ i=0 log p(y(i)|x(i), θ)+ λ 2 ‖θ‖2 (6)\nwhere p(y(i)|x(i), θ) is the confidence score of the golden label y(i) of the training instance x(i), m is the number of the training instances, λ is the regularization coefficient and θ is the parameter set.\nThe grammatical subjects of SIPs are chosen as the New Sources introduced by corresponding\nSIPs. Since we have identified events and SIPs, we identify relevant sources RS, which is initialized as RS = {AUTHOR}, for each event according to the definition. When traversing from the root of the dependency parse tree of the sentence to the current event, RS is updated as:\nRSn = RSn−1 ∪ {ns s} (7)\nwhere ns is a new source introduced by the corresponding SIP and s ∈ RSn−1. This is a recursive algorithm defined by Saurı́ (2008)."

We learn effective representations from Shortest Dependency Paths (SDP) by means of neural networks with attention. Different from previous studies, our model combines both BiLSTM and CNN properly which can learn meaningful features from SDPs and words, respectively.\nOur model has two outputs: one represents whether the event is Uu, Non-Uu or other, and the other shows whether the event is modified by the cue and then Non-Uu events are further classified into CT+/-, PR+/-, PS+/-. We have two main reasons for the design of the two outputs: 1) We can identify negative and speculative values (e.g., CT-, PR+/-, PS+/-) more precisely with the assistance of cues, and 2) this design can tackle the imbalance among instances, because the negative and speculative factuality values are usually in the minority. Finally, the event factuality is determined by these two outputs directly."

Notice that this path contains all the sources in the chain form.\nSIP Path: The SDP from the SIP that introduces the current source to the event.\nCue Path: The SDP from the cue to the event. In addition, we consider the Lexical Features to judge whether the event is modified by the cue: 1) Relative Position is defined as the distance from the cue to the event in the sentence, and is mapped into the vector lp with the dimension dp; 2) Type of Cue includes PR, PS and NEG and is mapped into the vector lt with the dimension dt.\nAuxiliary Words (Aux Words) include auxiliary and marker words that share the dependency relations aux or mark with the current event. Here, a marker is the word introducing a finite clause subordinate to the event. We argue that Aux Words can describe the syntactic structures of sentences.\nAn example sentence and its inputs for our neural networks are shown in Figure 4."

      "text" : "Traditional RNNs have problems called vanishing gradients during the gradient back-propagation phase. Overcoming these problems is the motivation behind the LSTM model (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) which introduces a memory cell including an input gate it, a neuron with a self-recurrent connection ct, a forget gate ft and an output gate ot. The values of components depend on the previous state ht−1 and the current input xt. Formally, LSTM is computed according to the following equations, where xt ∈ X , X ∈ Rd0×n is the matrix of the SDP:\nit = σ(Wixt +Uiht−1 + bi) (8)\nft = σ(Wfxt +Ufht−1 + bf ) (9)\not = σ(Woxt +Uoht−1 + bo) (10)\nc̃t = tanh(Wcxt +Ucht−1 + bc) (11)\nct = ft ct−1 + it c̃t (12) ht = ot tanh(ct) (13)\nwhere is the element-wise multiplication and σ is the sigmoid function. The dimension of hidden units in LSTM is set as d0. We can obtain H ∈ Rd0×n via the LSTM layer, where H = (h0,h1, . . . ,hn−1), ht ∈ Rd0(0 ≤ t ≤ n− 1).\nMany sequence modeling tasks are beneficial from the access to the future as well as past con-\ntext. Therefore, to model the representations of syntactic paths, we utilize the bidirectional LSTM network shown in Figure 5 which processes the syntactic path in both directions. It produces the forward hidden sequence ~H , the backward hidden sequence ~H and the output sequenceHp:\nHp = ~H + ~H (14)\nTo capture the most important information from the syntactic path effectively, we adopt the attention mechanism and get the output hp:\nM = tanh(Hp) (15)\nα = softmax(vTM) (16)\nhp = tanh(Hpα T ) (17)"

Table 2 presents the distribution of factuality values in FactBank. Following previous studies (Saurı́, 2008; de Marneffe et al., 2012), we only take into account the five main categories of values, i.e., CT+, CT-, PR+, PS+, and Uu, which make up 99.05% of all the instances.\nWe divide the corpus into 5 folds to perform 5-fold cross-validation. Precision, Recall, and F1-measure are employed to report the performance of each factuality value. To obtain the performance for the whole corpus, macro-averaging and micro-averaging are applied (Manning and Schütze, 2001). We choose two-sample two-tailed t-test for significance test.\nFor the SIP detection task, we set d0 = 100, dpos = dhyp = 50, nc = 150. For the event factuality identification task, we set d0 = 100, dp = dt = 10, nc = 50, = 0.25. We initialize word embeddings via Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and randomly initialize all the other parameters. The Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum is applied to optimize our models.\nIf there is more than one cue in the sentence, we consider whether the event is modified by each cue separately. If a Non-Uu event is affected by both PR and PS cues, we adopt the cue with the\nhighest confidence score in o2 to decide whether the modality of the event is PR or PS.\nWe employ the following baselines, whose inputs are the outputs of our basic factor extraction for the fair comparison with our model:\nRules: The rule-based model developed by Saurı́ (2008) is a top-down algorithm traversing a dependency parse tree.\nMaxEnt: We employ a maximum entropy classification model using the features developed by de Marneffe et al.

Hence, it is challenging to identify them. Compared with Rule-based and MaxEnt model, our attention-based neural network models achieve better results on CT-, PR+ and PS+. The higher macro-averaging indicates the performances are more balanced, and BiLSTM+CNN(Att) is superior to all the other baselines in terms of microand macro-averaging on All sources. However, if we concatenate fu and fcue in Equation (19)(20) into ONE vector and design only ONE output in BiLSTM+CNN(Att), we obtain good results on CT+ and Uu (F1=63.64 and 57.80), but results of CT-, PR+, PS+ are lower (F1=49.43, 33.06, 37.07). With the design of two outputs, BiLSTM+CNN(Att) achieves the highest F1 of PS+ (42.97) and the second highest F1 of CT-, PR+ (53.89 and 41.83), which can prove the advantages of the design of two outputs in our model and the usefulness of speculative and negative cues.\nParticularly, our BiLSTM model can obtain better results than CNN. Compared with the simple CNN which ignores the contexts, BiLSTM can learn features from both future and past contexts. Hence BiLSTM is able to ex-\ntract more effective representations from syntactic paths than CNN. For BiLSTM+CNN(Att) and CNN+CNN(Att) models, we get p < 0.05.\nThe performances of both CNN+CNN (p < 0.001) and BiLSTM+CNN (p < 0.05) models are improved after using attention, indicating that some factors (e.g., SIPs, cues, auxiliary words) in syntactic paths play the key roles in computing the factuality, while others have fewer effects. Therefore, attention is helpful to improve the results.\nThe F1 of BiLSTM+CNN(Att) on CT+ and Uu events whose sources are AUTHOR are slightly lower than those of MaxEnt model. CT+ and Uu values cover 95.45% among events with AUTHOR, so MaxEnt can also perform well on identifying them. But BiLSTM+CNN(Att) achieves higher F1 on CT- (p < 0.001), PR+ (p < 0.05) and PS+ (p < 0.001) on AUTHOR.\nHowever, F1 of Uu on embedded sources of BiLSTM+CNN(Att) is quite low (26.26), which is similar to other models. On one hand, Uu only covers 23.99% among events with embedded sources. On the other hand, the events embedded in other sources usually have complex syntactic structures. Therefore, it is difficult to judge whether these events are Uu or Non-Uu. Compared with MaxEnt model, however, BiLSTM+CNN(Att) achieves better performances on\nCT-, PR+, PS+ events with AUTHOR (CT-, PS+: p < 0.001) and on all the five categories of values with embedded sources (p < 0.001).

SIP Path can greatly improve the results (p < 0.001), proving that SIPs are key factors to determine the event factuality and can offer meaningful syntactic information to discriminate Non-Uu events from Uu ones. Finally, auxiliary words make further improvement on results, because they can reflect the pragmatic structures of sentences, just as described in Section 4. For example:\n(S6) He also is charged in the 1996 Olympic bombing, which killed one person.\n(S7) The environmental commission must adopt regulations to ensure people are not exposed to radioactive waste.\nIn S6, the auxiliary word “which” leads the relative clause “which killed one person” containing the CT+ event killed.
