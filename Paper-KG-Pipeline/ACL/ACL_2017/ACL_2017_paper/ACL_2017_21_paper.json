      "text" : "A hypernym of an entity characterizes the type or the class of the entity. For example, the word country is the hypernym of the entity Canada. The accurate prediction of hypernyms benefits a variety of NLP tasks, such as taxonomy learning (Wu et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2014), fine-grained entity categorization (Ren et al., 2016), knowledge base construction (Suchanek et al., 2007), etc.\nIn previous work, the detection of hypernyms requires lexical, syntactic and/or semantic analysis of relations between entities and their respective hypernyms from a language-specific knowledge source. For example, Hearst (1992) is the pioneer work to extract is-a relations from a text corpus based on handcraft patterns. The followingup work mostly focuses on is-a relation extraction using automatically generated patterns (Snow et al., 2004; Ritter et al., 2009; Sang and Hof-\nmann, 2009; Kozareva and Hovy, 2010) and relation inference based on distributional similarity measures (Kotlerman et al., 2010; Lenci and Benotto, 2012; Shwartz et al., 2016).\nWhile these approaches have relatively high precision over English corpora, extracting hypernyms for entities is still challenging for Chinese. From the linguistic perspective, Chinese is a lower-resourced language with very flexible expressions and grammatical rules (Wang et al., 2015). For instance, there are no word spaces, explicit tenses and voices, and distinctions between singular and plural forms in Chinese. The order of words can be changed flexibly in sentences. Hence, as previous research indicates, hypernym extraction methods for English are not necessarily suitable for the Chinese language (Fu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Wang and He, 2016).\nBased on such conditions, several classification methods are proposed to distinguish is-a and notis-a relations based on Chinese encyclopedias (Lu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015). Similar to Princeton WordNet, a few Chinese wordnets have also been developed (Huang et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2008; Wang and Bond, 2013). The most recent approaches for Chinese is-a relation extraction (Fu et al., 2014; Wang and He, 2016) use word embedding based linear projection models to map embeddings of hyponyms to those of their hypernyms, which outperform previous algorithms.\nHowever, we argue that these projection-based methods may have three potential limitations: (i) Only positive is-a relations are used for projection learning. The distinctions between is-a and not-is-a relations in the embedding space are not modeled. (ii) These methods lack the capacity to encode linguistic rules, which are designed by linguists and usually have high precision. (iii) It assumes that the linguistic regularities of is-a relations can be solely captured by single or multiple\nlinear projection models. In this paper, we address these limitations by a two-stage transductive learning approach. It distinguishes is-a and not-is-a relations given a Chinese word/phrase pair as input. In the initial stage, we train linear projection models on positive and negative training data separately and predict isa relations jointly. In the transductive learning stage, the initial prediction results, linguistic rules and the non-linear mappings from entities to hypernyms are optimized simultaneously in a unified framework. This optimization problem can be efficiently solved by blockwise gradient descent. We evaluate our method over two public datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for Chinese hypernym prediction.1\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. We summarize the related work in Section 2. Our approach is introduced in Section 3. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. We conclude our paper in Section 5.2"

      "text" : "In this section, we overview the related work on hypernym prediction and discuss the challenges of Chinese hypernym detection.\nPattern based methods identify is-a relations from texts by handcraft or automatically generated patterns. Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992) are lexical patterns in English that are employed to extract isa relations for taxonomy construction (Wu et al., 2012). Automatic approaches mostly use iterative learning paradigms such that the system learns new is-a relations and patterns simultaneously. A few relevant studies can be found in (Caraballo, 1999; Etzioni et al., 2004; Sang, 2007; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Kozareva and Hovy, 2010). To avoid “semantic drift” in iterations, Snow et al. (2004) train a hypernym classifier based on syntactic features based on parse trees. Carlson et al. (2010) exploit multiple learners to extract relations via coupled learning. These approaches are\n1While there is abundant research on hypernym prediction for English with high precision, we mostly focus on the Chinese language in this paper. However, the proposed method is not entirely language-specific and has the potential to be adapted to other languages. In Section 4, we provide additional experiments to show that our approach also outperforms several existing methods for hypernym prediction in the English environment. We also discuss some potential applications of our method.\n2Additionally, we present more details on algorithms and experimental settings and a prototype system for taxonomy visualization in the supplementary notes.\nnot effective for Chinese for two reasons: i) Chinese is-a relations are expressed in a highly flexible manner (Fu et al., 2014) and ii) the accuracy of basic NLP tasks such as dependency parsing still need improvement for Chinese (Li et al., 2013).\nInference based methods take advantage of distributional similarity measures (DSM) to infer relations between words. They assume that a hypernym may appear in all contexts of the hyponyms and a hyponym can only appear in part of the contexts of its hypernyms. In previous work, Kotlerman et al. (2010) design directional DSMs to model the asymmetric property of is-a relations. Other DSMs are introduced in (Bhagat et al., 2007; Szpektor et al., 2007; Lenci and Benotto, 2012; Santus et al., 2014). Shwartz et al. (2016) combine dependency parsing and DSM to improve the performance of hypernymy detection. The reason why DSM is not effective for Chinese is that the contexts of entities in Chinese are flexible and sparse.\nEncyclopedia based methods take encyclopedias as knowledge sources to construct taxonomies. Ponzetto and Strube (2007) design features from multiple aspects to predict is-a relations between entities and categories in English Wikipedia. The taxonomy in YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) is constructed by linking conceptual categories in Wikipedia to WordNet synsets (Miller, 1995). For Chinese, Li et al. (2015) propose an SVM-based approach to build a large Chinese taxonomy from Wikipedia. Similar classification based algorithms are presented in (Fu et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2015). Due to the lack of Chinese version of WordNet, several Chinese semantic dictionaries have been conducted, such as Sinica BOW (Huang et al., 2004), SEW (Xu et al., 2008), COW (Wang and Bond, 2013), etc. These approaches have higher accuracy than mining hypernym relations from texts directly. However, they heavily rely on existing knowledge sources and are difficult to extend to different domains.\nTo tackle these challenges, word embedding based methods directly model the task of hypernym prediction as learning a mapping from entity vectors to their respective hypernym vectors in the embedding space. The vectors can be pretrained by neural language models (Mikolov et al., 2013). For the Chinese language, Fu et al. (2014) train piecewise linear projection models based on a Chinese thesaurus. The state-of-the-art method\n(Wang and He, 2016) combines an iterative learning procedure and Chinese Hearst-style patterns to improve the performance of projection models. They can reduce data noise by avoiding direct parsing of Chinese texts, but still capture the linguistic regularities of is-a relations based on word embeddings. Additionally, several work aims to study how to combine word embeddings for relation classification, such as (Mirza and Tonelli, 2016). In our paper, we extend these approaches by modeling non-linear mappings from entities to hypernyms and adding linguistic rules via a unified transductive learning framework."

The input is a positive is-a set D+, a negative is-a set D− and an unlabeled set DU , all of which are the collections of word/phrase pairs.\nDenote xi as the embedding vector of word xi, pre-trained and stored in a lookup table. In the initial stage, we train a linear projection model over D+ such that for each (xi, yi) ∈ D+, a projection matrix maps the entity vector xi to its hypernym vector yi. A similar model is also trained over D−. Based on the two models, we estimate the prediction score and the confidence score for each (xi, yi) ∈ DU . In the transductive learning stage, a joint optimization problem is formed to learn the final prediction score for each (xi, yi) ∈ DU . It aims to minimize the prediction errors based on the human labeled data, the initial model prediction and linguistic rules. It also employs nonlinear mappings to capture linguistic regularities of is-a relations other than linear projections."

We first train a Skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) to learn word embeddings over a large text corpus. Inspired by\n(Fu et al., 2014; Wang and He, 2016), for each (xi, yi) ∈ D+, we assume there is a positive projection model such that M+xi ≈ yi where M+ is an |xi| × |xi| projection matrix3. However, this model does not capture the semantics of not-isa relations. Thus, we learn a negative projection model M−xi ≈ yi where (xi, yi) ∈ D−. This approach is equivalent to learning two separate translation models within the same semantic space. For parameter estimation, we minimize the two following objectives:\nJ(M+) = 1\n2 ∑ (xi,yi)∈D+ ‖M+xi−yi‖22+ λ 2 ‖M+‖2F\nJ(M−) = 1\n2 ∑ (xi,yi)∈D− ‖M−xi−yi‖22+ λ 2 ‖M−‖2F\nwhere λ > 0 is a Tikhonov regularization parameter (Golub et al., 1999).\nIn the testing phase, for each (xi, yi) ∈ DU , denote d+(xi, yi) = ‖M+xi − yi‖2 and d−(xi, yi) = ‖M−xi−yi‖2. The prediction score is defined as:\nscore(xi, yi) = tanh(d −(xi, yi)− d+(xi, yi))\nwhere score(xi, yi) ∈ (−1, 1). Higher prediction score indicates there is a larger probability of an is-a relation between xi and yi. We choose the hyperbolic tangent function rather than the sigmoid function to avoid the widespread saturation of sigmoid function (Menon et al., 1996).\nThe difference between d+(xi, yi) and d−(xi, yi) can be also used to indicate whether the models are confident enough to make a prediction. In this paper, we calculate the confidence score as:\nconf(xi, yi) = |d+(xi, yi)− d−(xi, yi)| max{d+(xi, yi), d−(xi, yi)} 3We have also examined piecewise linear projection models proposed in (Fu et al., 2014; Wang and He, 2016) as the initial models for transductive learning. However, we found that this practice is less efficient and the performance does not improve significantly.\nwhere conf(xi, yi) ∈ (0, 1). Higher confidence score means that there is a larger probability that the models can predict whether there is an is-a relation between xi and yi correctly. This score gives different data instances different weights in the transductive learning stage."

(2015) study the word formation of conceptual categories in Chinese Wikipedia. In our model, let C be the collection of linguistic rules. γi is the true positive (or negative) rate with respect to the respective positive (or negative) rule ci ∈ C, estimated over the training set. Considering the word formation of Chinese entities and hypernyms, we design one positive rule (i.e., P1) and two negative rules (i.e., N1 and N2), shown in Table 1.\nLet R be an m × 1 linguistic rule vector and Ri is the ith element in R. For training data, we set Ri = 1 if (xi, yi) ∈ D+ and Ri = −1 if (xi, yi) ∈ D−, which follows the same settings as those in S. For unlabeled pairs that do not match any linguistic rules in C, we update Ri = Fi in each iteration of the learning process, meaning no loss for errors imposed in this part.\nFor other conditions, denote C(xi,yi) ⊆ C as the collection of rules that (xi, yi) matches. If C(xi,yi) are positive rules, we set Ri as follows:\nRi = max{Fi, max cj∈C(xi,yi) γj}\nSimilarly, if C(xi,yi) are negative rules, we have:\nRi = −max{−Fi, max cj∈C(xi,yi) γj}\nwhich means Fi receives a penalty only if Fi < maxcj∈C(xi,yi) γj for pairs that match positive rules or Fi > −maxcj∈C(xi,yi) γj for negative rules4.

      "text" : "TransLP is a transductive label propagation framework (Liu and Yang, 2015) for link prediction, previously used for applications such as text classification (Xu et al., 2016). In our work, we extend their work for our task, modeling non-linear mappings from entities to hypernyms.\nFor is-a relations, we find that if y is the hypernym of x, it is likely that y is the hypernym of entities that are semantically close to x. For example,\n4We do not consider the cases where a pair matches both positive and negative rules because such cases are very rare, and even non-existent in our datasets. However, our method can deal with these cases by using some simple heuristics. For example, we can update Ri using either of the following two ways: i) Ri = Fi and ii) Ri = Fi + ∑ cj∈C(xi,yi) γj .\nif we know United States is a country, we can infer country is the hypernym of similar entities such as Canada, Australia, etc. This intuition can be encoded in the similarity of the two pairs pi = (xi, yi) and pj = (xj , yj):\nsim(pi, pj) =\n{ cos(xi,xj) yi = yj\n0 otherwise (1)\nwhere xi is the embedding vector of xi5. This similarity indicates there exists a nonlinear mapping from entities to hypernyms, which can not be encoded in linear projection based methods (Fu et al., 2014; Wang and He, 2016). Based on TransLP (Liu and Yang, 2015), this intuition can be model as propagating class labels (is-a or not-is-a) of labeled word/phrase pairs to similar unlabeled ones based on Eq. (1). For example, the score of is-a relations between United State and country will propagate to pairs such as (Canada, country) and (Australia, country) by random walks.\nDenote F∗ as the optimal solution of the problem min Os + Or. Inspired by (Liu and Yang, 2015; Xu et al., 2016), we can add a Gaussian prior N(F∗,Σ) to F where Σ is the covariance matrix and Σi,j = sim(pi, pj). Hence the optimization objective of this part is defined as: On = FTΣ−1F which is linearly proportional to the negative likelihood of the Gaussian random field prior. This means we minimize the training error and encourage F to have a smooth propagation with respect to the similarities among pairs defined by Eq. (1) at the same time."

For example, nouns close to country in our Skip-gram model are region, department, etc. They are not all correct hypernyms of United States, Canada, Australia, etc.\nwhere ‖F‖22 imposes an additional smooth l2regularization on F. µ1 and µ2 are tuning parameters.\nA basic approach to learn the optimal values of F is via gradient descent. Based on Eq. (2), the derivative of F with respect to J(F) can be computed as follows:\ndJ(F) dF = W2(F−S)+(F−R)+µ1Σ−1F+µ2F\nOptimizing Eq. (2) is computationally expensive when m is large. After W2, S, R and Σ−1 are pre-computed, the runtime complexity of the loop of gradient descent is O(tm2) where t is the number of iterations.\nTo speed up the learning process, we introduce a blockwise gradient descent technique. From the definition of Eq. (2), we can see that the optimal values of Fi and Fj with respect to (xi, yi) and (xj , yj) are irrelevant if yi 6= yj . Therefore, the original optimization problem can be decomposed and solved separately according to different candidate hypernyms.\nLetH be the collection of candidate hypernyms in DU . For each h ∈ H , denote Dh as the collection of word/phase pairs in D+ ∪ D− ∪ DU that share the same candidate hypernym h. The original problem can be decomposed into |H| optimization subproblems over Dh for each h ∈ H . The runtime complexity is O( ∑ h∈Dh th|Dh|\n2) where th is the number of iterations to solve the subproblem over Dh. Although we do not know the upper bounds on the numbers of iterations of these two learning techniques, the runtime complexity can be reduced by blockwise gradient descent for two reasons: i) ∑ h∈Dh |Dh| ≤ m and ii) th has a large probability to be smaller than t due to the smaller number of data instances. This technique can be also viewed as optimizing Eq. (2) based on blockwise matrix computation.\nFinally, for each (xi, yi) ∈ DU , we predict that yi is a hypernym of xi if Fi > θ where θ ∈ (−1, 1) is a threshold tuned on the development set."

As their experiments show, these methods achieve the Fmeasure of lower than 60% in most cases, which are not suggested to be strong baselines for Chinese hypernym prediction. Interested readers may refer to their papers for the experimental results.\nTo make the convincing conclusion, we employ two recent state-of-the-art approaches for Chinese is-a relation identification (Fu et al., 2014; Wang and He, 2016) as baselines. We also take the word embedding based classification approach (Mirza and Tonelli, 2016)9 and Chinese Wikipedia based SVM model (Li et al., 2015) as baselines to predict is-a relations between words10. The experimental results are illustrated in Table 3.\nFor Fu et al., (2014), we test the performance using a linear projection model (denoted as S in Table 3) and piecewise projection models (P). It shows that the semantics of is-a relations are better modeled by multiple projection models, with a slightly improvement in F-measure.

The main reason of the improvement may be that the projection models have a better generalization power by applying an iterative learning paradigm.\nMirza and Tonelli, (2016) is implemented using three different strategies in combining the word vectors of a pair: i) concatenation xi ⊕ yi (denoted as C), ii) addition xi + yi (A) and iii) subtraction xi − yi (S). As seen, the classification models using addition and subtraction have similar performance in two datasets, while the concatenation strategy outperforms previous two approaches.

In the experiments, we treat the HYPER relations as positive data (1,337 pairs) and randomly sample 30% of the RANDOM relations as negative data (3,754 pairs) in BLESS.

By modeling linear projection models, linguistic rules and non-linear mappings, our method is able to identify Chinese hypernyms with high accuracy. Experiments show that the performance of our method outperforms previous approaches. We also discuss the potential applications of our method besides Chinese hypernym prediction.\n11The implementations of these applications are beyond the scope of this paper."
