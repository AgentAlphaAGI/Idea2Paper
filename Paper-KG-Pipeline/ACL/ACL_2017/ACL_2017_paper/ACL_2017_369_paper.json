      "text" : "Machine Translation (MT) is evolving from different perspectives. One of the most popular paradigms is still Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), which consists in finding the most probable target sentence given the source sentence using probabilistic models based on co-ocurrences. Recently, deep learning techniques applied to natural language processing, speech recognition and image processing and even in MT have reached quite successful results. Early stages of deep learning applied to MT include using neural language modeling for rescoring (Schwenk et al., 2007). Later,\ndeep learning has been integrated in MT in many different steps (Zhand and Zong, 2015). Nowadays, deep learning has allowed to develop an entire new paradigm, which within one-year of development has achieved state-of-the-art results (Jean et al., 2015) for some language pairs.\nIn this paper, we are focusing on a challenging translation task, which is Chinese-to-Spanish. This translation task has the characteristic that we are going from an isolated language in terms of morphology (Chinese) to a fusional language (Spanish). This means that for a simple word in Chinese (e.g. 鼓励 ), the corresponding translation has many different morphology inflexions (e.g. alentar, alienta, alentamos, alientan ...), which depend on the context. It is still difficult for MT in general (no matter which paradigm) to extract information from the source context to give the correct translation.\nWe propose to divide the problem of translation into translation and then a postprocessing of morphology generation. This has been done before, e.g. (Toutanova et al., 2008; Formiga et al., 2013), as we will review in the next section. However, the main contribution of our work is that we are using deep learning techniques in morphology generation. This gives us significant improvements in translation quality.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the related work both in morphology generation approaches and in ChineseSpanish translation. Section 3 overviews the phrase-based MT approach together with an explanation of the divide and conquer approach of translating and generating morphology. Section 4 details the architecture of the morphology generation module and it reports the main classification techniques that are used for morphology generation. Section 5 describes the experimental framework. Section 6 reports and discusses both clas-\nsification and translation results, which show significant improvements. Finally, section 7 summarises the main conclusions and further work."

      "heading" : "2 Related Work",
      "text" : "In this section we are reviewing the previous related works on morphology generation for MT and on Chinese-Spanish MT approaches.\nMorphology generation There have been many works in morphological generation and some of them are in the context of the application of MT. In this cases, MT is faced in two-steps: first step where the source is translated to a simplified target text that has less morphology variation than the original target; and then, second step, a postprocessing module (morphology generator) adds the proper inflections. To name a few of these works, for example, (Toutanova et al., 2008) build maximum entropy markov models for inflection prediction of stems; (Clifton and Sarkar, 2011) and (Kholy and Habash, 2012) use conditional random fields (CFR) to predict one or more morphological features; and (Formiga et al., 2013) use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to predict verb inflections. Other related works are in the context of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging generation such as (Giménez and Màrquez, 2004) in which a model is trained to predict each individual fragment of a PoS tag by means of machine learning algorithms. The main difference is that in PoS tagging the word itself has information about morphological inflection, whereas in our task, we do not have this information.\nIn this paper, we use deep learning techniques to morphology generation or classification. Based on the fact that Chinese does not have number and gender inflections and Spanish does, (Costajussà, 2015) show that simplification in gender and number has the best trade-off between improving translation and keeping the morphology generation complexity at a low level.\nChinese-Spanish There are few works in Chinese-Spanish MT despite being two of the most spoken languages in the world. Most of these works are based on comparing different pivot strategies like standard cascade or pseudo-corpus (Costa-jussà et al., 2012). Also it is important to mention that, in 2008, there were two tasks organised by the popular IWSLT\nevaluation campaign1 (International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation) between these two languages (Paul, 2008). The first task was based on a direct translation for Chinese-Spanish. The second task provided corpus in Chinese-English and English-Spanish and asked participants to provide Chinese-Spanish translation through pivot techniques. The second task obtained better results than direct translation because of the larger corpus provided. Differently, (Costa-jussà and Centelles, 2016) present the first rule-based MT system for Chinese to Spanish. Authors describe a hybrid method for constructing this system taking advantage of available resources such as parallel corpora that are used to extract dictionaries and lexical and structural transfer rules. Finally, it is worth mentioning that novel successful neural approximations (Jean et al., 2015), already mentioned in the introduction, have not yet achieved state-of-the-art results for this language pair (Costa-jussà et al., 2017)."

      "text" : "The popular phrase-based MT system (Koehn et al., 2003) focuses on finding the most probable target text given a source text. In the last 20 years, the phrase-based system has dramatically evolved introducing new techniques and modifying the architecture; for example, replacing the noisychannel for the log-linear model which combines a set of feature functions in the decoder, including the translation and language model, the reordering model and the lexical models. There is a widely used open-source software, Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), which englobes a large community that helps in the progress of the system. As a consequence, phrase-based MT is a commoditized technology used at the academic and commercial level. However, there are still many challenges to solve, such as morphology generation.\n1http://iwslt2010.fbk.eu"

      "heading" : "3.2 Divide and conquer MT architecture: simplified translation and morphology generation",
      "text" : "Morphology generation is not always achieved in the standard phrase-based system. This may be due to the fact that phrase-based MT uses a limited source context information to translate. Therefore, we are proposing to follow a similar strategy to previous works (Toutanova et al., 2008; Formiga et al., 2013), where authors do a first translation from source to a morphology-based simplified target and then, use the morphology generation module that transforms the simplified translation into the full form output."

      "heading" : "4 Morphological Generation Module",
      "text" : "In order to design the morphology generation module, we have to decide the morphology simplification we are applying to the translation. Since we are focusing on Chinese-to-Spanish task and based on (Costa-jussà, 2015), the simplification which achieves the best trade-off among highest translation gain and lowest complexity of morphological generation is the simplification in number and gender. Table 1 shows examples of this simplification. The main challenge of this task is that number and gender are generated from words where this inflection information (both number and gender) has been removed beforehand.\nWith these results at hand, we propose an architecture of the morphology generation module, which is language independent and it is easily generalizable to other simplification schemes.\nThe morphology generation procedure is summarised as follows and further detailed in the next subsections.\n• Feature selection. We have investigated different set of features including information from both source and target languages.\n• Classification. We propose a new deep learning classification architecture composed of different layers.\n• Rescoring and rules. We generate different alternatives of the classification output and rerank them using a language model. After, we use hand-crafted rules that allow to solve some specific problems.\nThis procedure is depicted in Figure 1, in which we can see that each of the above processes gener-\nates the needed input for the next step. Figure also shows in red the main subprocesses that have been developed on this work."

      "heading" : "4.1 Feature selection",
      "text" : "We propose to compare several features for recovering morphological information. Given that both Chinese and simplified Spanish languages do not contain explicit morphology information, we start by simply using windows of words as source of information. We follow Collobert’s approach in which each word is represented by a fixed size window of words in which the central element is the one to classify (Collobert et al., 2011).\nIn our case, we experiment with three different inputs: (1) Chinese window; (2) simplified Spanish window; (3) Spanish window adding information about its correspondant word in Chinese, i.e. information about pronouns and the number of characters in the word. The main advantage of the second one is that it is not dependant on the alignment file generated during translation.\nOur classifiers did not have to train all types of words. Some types of words, such as prepositions (a, ante, cabo, de...), do not have gender or number. Therefore our system was trained using only determiners, adjectives, verbs, pronouns and nouns which are the ones that present morphology\n.\nvariations in gender or number. However, note that all types of words are used in the windows."

      "heading" : "4.2 Classification architecture",
      "text" : "Description We propose to train two different models: one to retrieve gender and another to retrieve number. Each model decides among three different classes. Classes for gender classifier are masculine (M ), femenine (F ) and none (N ); and classes for number classifier are singular (S), plural (P ) and none (N ) 2. Again, we inspire our architecture in previous Collobert’s proposal and we modify it by adding a recurrent neural network. This recurrent neural network is relevant because it keeps information about previous elements in a sequence and, in our classification problem, context words are very relevant. As a recurrent neural network, we use a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) that is proven efficient to deal with sequence NLP challenges (Sutskever et al., 2014). This kind of recurrent neural network is able to maintain information for several elements in the sequence and to forget it when needed. Figure 2 shows an overview of the different layers involved in the final classification architecture, which are detailed as follows:\nEmbedding. We represent each word as its index in the vocabulary, i.e. every word is represented as one discrete value: E(w) = W,W ∈ Rd, w being the index of the word in the sorted vocabulary and d the user chosen size of the array. Then, each word is represented as a numeric array and each window is a matrix.\nConvolutional. We add a convolutional neural network. This step allows the system to detect some common patterns between the different\n2None means that there is no need to specify gender or number information because the word is invariant in these terms. This happens for types of words (determiners, nouns, verbs, pronouns and adjectives) that can have gender and number in other cases.\nwords. This layer’s input consists in W l matrix of multidimensional arrays of size n · d, where n is the window length (in words) and d is the size of the array created by the previous embedding layer. This layer’s output is a matrix of the same size as the input.\nMax Pooling. This layer allows to extract most relevant features from the input data and reduces feature vectors to half.\nLSTM. Each feature array is treated individually, generating a fixed size representation hi of the ith word using information of all the previous words (in the sequence). This layer’s output, h, is the result of the last element of the sequence using information from all previous words.\nSigmoid. This layer smoothes results obtained by previous layer and compresses results to the interval [−1, 1]. This layer’s input is a fixed size vector of shape 1 ·n where n is the number of neurons in the previous LSTM layer. This layer’s output is a vector of length c equal to the number of classes to predict.\nSoftmax. This layer allows to show results as probabilities by ensuring that the returned value of each class belongs to the [0, 1) interval and all classes add up 1.\nMotivation Our input data is PoS tagged and morphogically simplified before the classification architecture which largely reduces the information that can be extracted from individual words in the vocabulary. In addition, we can encounter out-ofvocabulary words for which no morphological information can be extracted.\nThe main source of information available is the context in which the word can be found in the sentence. Considering the window as a sequence enforces the behaviour a human would have while reading the sentence. The information of a word consists in itself and the words that surround it. Sometimes information preceeds the word and sometimes information is after the word. Words\n(like adjetives), which are modifying or complementing another word, generally take information from preceeding words. For example, in the sequence casa blanca, the word blanca could also be blanco, blancos or blancas but because noun and adjective are required to have gender and number agreement, the femenine word casa forces the femenine for blanca. While, for example, determiners usually take information from posterior words. This fact motivates that the word to classify has to be placed at the center of the window.\nFinally, given that we rely only on the context information since words themselves may not have any information, makes the recurrent neural network a key element in our architecture. The output h of the layer can be considered a context vector of the whole window maintaining information of all the previously encountered words (in the same window)."

      "text" : "At this point in the pipeline, we have two models (gender and number) that allow us to generate the full Part-of-Speech (PoS) tag by combining the best results of both classifiers.\nHowever, in order to improve the overall performance, we add a rescoring step followed by some hand-crafted rules. To generate the different alternatives, we represent every sentence as a graph (see Figure 3), with the following properties:\n• Each word is represented as a layer of the graph and each node represents a class of the\nclassification model.\n• A node only has edges with all the nodes of the next layer. This way we force the original sentence order.\n• An edge’s weight is the probability given by the classification model.\n• Each accepted path in the graph starts in the first layer and ends in the last one. This acyclic structure finds the best path in linear time, due to the fact that it goes through all layers and it picks the node with the greatest weight. One layer can have either 1 element (the word does not need to be classified, e.g. prepositions) or 3 elements (the word needs to be classified among the three number or gender categories).\n• Add the weight of a previously trained target language model.\nWe used Yen’s algorithm (Yen, 1971) to find the best path, which has an associated cost of O(KN2logN), being K the number of paths to find.\nSee pseudo code in Algorithm 1, where A is the set paths chosen in the graph. The algorithm ends when this A set contains K paths or no further paths available to explore. B contains all suboptimal paths that can be elected in future iterations.\nThere are two special cases that the models were not able to treat and we apply specific rules: (1) conjunctions y and o are replaced by e and u if they are placed in front of vowels. This could not be generated during translation because both words share the same tag and lemma; (2) verbs with a pronoun as a suffix, producirse, second to\nlast syllabe stretched (palabras llanas) and ending in a vowel are not accentuated. However, after adding the suffix, these words should be accentuated because they become palabras esdrújulas, which happen to be always accentuated.\nData: G Graph of the sentence, K Result: best k paths in G initialization; A[0] = bestPath(G,0,final); B = [] ; i = 0; for i <K do\nfor i in range(0, len(A[K-1])-1) do spurNode = A[K-1][i]; root = A[K-1][0;i]; for path in A do\nif root = path[0:i] then remove edge(i-1,i) from G;\nend end for node in root and node != spurNode do\nremoves node node from G; end spurPath = bestPath(G,spurnode, final) totalPath = root + spurPath; B.append(totalPath); restore edges from G; restore nodes from G; if B is empty then\nbreak; end B.sort(); A.append(B[0]); B.pop();\nend end\nAlgorithm 1: Pseudo-code for k-best paths generation."

Table 3 summarizes these parameters. The best window size is 9 and 7 words for number and gender, respectively. In both cases increasing this size lowers the accuracy of the system. The vocabulary size is fixed as a trade-off between giving enough information to the system to perform the classification while removing enough words to train the classifier for unknown words. The embedding size of 128 results in stable training, while further increasing this value augmented the training time and hardware cost. The filter size in the convolutional layer reached best results when it was slightly smaller than the window size, being 7 and 5 the best values for number and gender classification, respectively.

All algorithms were tested using features and parameters described in previous sections with the exception of random forests in which we added the one hot encoding representation of the words to the features.\nWe observe that our proposed architecture achieves by large the best results in all tasks. It is also remarkable that the accuracy is lower using the bigger corpus, this is due to the fact that the small set consisted in texts of the same domain and the vocabulary had a better representation of specific words such as country names.\nTabla 6 shows translation results. We show both the Oracle and the result in terms of METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).

As further work, we intend to further simplify morphology and extend the scope of the classification."

In this paper, we propose to de-couple machine translation from morphology generation in order to better deal with the problem. We investigate the morphology simplification with a reasonable trade-off between expected gain and generation complexity. For the Chinese-Spanish task, optimum morphological simplification is in gender and number. For this purpose, we design a new classification architecture which, compared to other standard machine learning techniques, obtains the best results. This proposed neural-based architecture consists of several layers: an embedding, a convolutional followed by a recurrent neural network and, finally, ends with sigmoid and softmax layers. We obtain classification results over 98% accuracy in gender classification, over 93% in number classification, and an overall translation improvement of 0.7 METEOR.",
