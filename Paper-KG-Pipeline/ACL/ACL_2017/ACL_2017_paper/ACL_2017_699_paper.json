      "text" : "Keyphrase or keyword is a piece of short and summative content that expresses the main semantic meaning of a long text. A typical use of keyphrase or keyword is in scientific publications, to provide the core information of a paper. We use the term “keyphrase”, interchangeable as “keyword”, in the rest of this paper, as it implies that it may contain multiple words. High-quality keyphrases can facilitate the understanding, organizing and accessing of document content. As a result, many stud-\nies have devoted to studying the ways of automatic extracting keyphrases from textual content (Liu et al., 2009; Medelyan et al., 2009a; Witten et al., 1999). Due to the public accessibility, many scientific publication datasets are often used as the test beds for keyphrase extraction algorithms. Therefore, this study also focuses on extracting keyphrases from scientific publications.\nAutomatically extracting keyphrases from a document is called Keypharase Extraction, and it has been widely exploited in many applications, such as information retrieval (Jones and Staveley, 1999), text summarization (Zhang et al., 2004), text categorization (Hulth and Megyesi, 2006), and opinion mining (Berend, 2011). Most of the existing keyphrase extraction algorithms addressed this problem through two steps (Liu et al., 2009; Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003). The first step is to acquire a list of keyphrase candidates. Researchers have tried to use n-grams or noun phrases with certain part-of-speech patterns for identifying the potential candidates (Hulth, 2003; Le et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016). The second step is to rank candidates regarding their importance to the document, either through supervised or unsupervised machine learning methods with a set of manuallydefined features (Frank et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2009, 2010; Kelleher and Luz, 2005; Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Song et al., 2003; Witten et al., 1999).\nThere are two major drawbacks for the above keyphrase extraction approaches.\nFirstly, they can only extract the keyphrases that appear in the source text, whereas they fail at predicting the meaningful keyphrases with a slightly different sequential order or using synonym words. However, it is common in a scientific publication where authors assign keyphrases based on the semantic meaning instead of follow-\ning the written content in the publication. In this paper, we denote the phrases that do not match any contiguous subsequence of source text as absent keyphrases, and the ones that fully match a part of the text as present keyphrases. Table 1 shows the proportion of present and absent keyphrases from the document abstract in four commonlyused datasets, where we observe large portions of absent keyphrases in all the datasets. The absent keyphrases cannot be extracted through previous approaches, which further urges the development of a more powerful keyphrase prediction model.\nSecondly, when ranking phrase candidates, previous approaches often adopted the machine learning features such as TF-IDF and PageRank. However, these features only target to detect the importance of each word in the document based on the statistics of word occurrence and co-occurrence, whereas they can hardly reveal the semantics behind the document content.\nTo overcome the limitations of previous studies, we re-examine the process of Keyphrase Prediction, about how real human annotators would assign keyphrases. Given a document, human annotators will firstly read the text to get a basic understanding of the content, then they try to digest its essential content and summarize into keyphrases. Their generation of keyphrases relies on the understanding of the content, which not necessarily to be the words that occurred in the source text. For example, when human annotators see “Latent Dirichlet Allocation” in the text, they could write down “topic modeling” and/or “text mining” as possible keyphrases. In addition to the semantic understanding, human annotators might also go back and picks up the most important parts based on syntactic features. For example, the phrases following “we propose/apply/use” are supposed to be important in the text. As a result, a better keyphrase prediction model should understand the semantic meaning of the content, as well as capture the contextual features.\nTo effectively capture semantic and syntactic features, we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Cho et al., 2014; Gers and Schmidhuber, 2001) to compress the semantic information in the given text into a dense vector (i.e., semantic understanding). Furthermore, we incorporate a copy mechanism (Gu et al., 2016) to equip our model with the capability of finding important parts based on language syntax (i.e., syntactic understanding). Thus, our model can generate keyphrases based on the understanding of the text, no matter whether the keyphrases are present in the text or not; meanwhile, it does not lose important in-text information.\nThe contribution of this paper is in three-fold: a) we propose to apply an RNN-based generative model to keyphrase prediction, and we also incorporate a copy mechanism in RNN, which enables the model to successfully predict rarely-occurred phrases; b) this is the first work concerning about the problem of absent keyphrase prediction for scientific publications, and our model recalls up to 20% of absent keyphrases; and c) we conduct a comprehensive comparison against six important baselines on a broad range of datasets, and the results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised extraction methods.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we firstly review the related work in Section 2. Then we elaborate the proposed model in Section 3. After that, we present the experiment setting in Section 4 and results in Section 5, followed by our discussion in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper."

      "text" : "Keyphrase provides a succinct and accurate way of describing a subject or a subtopic in a document. A number of extraction algorithms have been proposed, and typically the process of extracting can be broken down into two steps.\nThe first step is to generate a list of phrase candidates with heuristic methods. As these candidates are prepared for further filtering, a considerable amount of candidates are produced in this step to increase the possibility that most of the correct keyphrases are kept. The primary ways of extracting candidates include retaining word sequences that match certain part-of-speech tag patterns (e.g., nouns, adjectives) (Liu et al., 2011;\nWang et al., 2016; Le et al., 2016), and extracting important n-grams or noun phrases (Hulth, 2003; Medelyan et al., 2008).\nThe second step is to score each candidate phrase regarding its likelihood of being a keyphrase in the given document. The top-ranked candidates are returned as keyphrases. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods are widely employed here. For supervised methods, this task is solved as a binary classification problem, and various of learning methods and features have been explored (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999; Hulth, 2003; Medelyan et al., 2009b; Lopez and Romary, 2010; Gollapalli and Caragea, 2014). As for the unsupervised approaches, primary ideas include finding the central nodes in text graph (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Grineva et al., 2009), detecting representative phrases from topical clusters (Liu et al., 2009, 2010) and so on.\nAside from the commonly adopted two steps process, another two previous studies realized the keyphrase extraction in entirely different ways. Tomokiyo and Hurst (2003) applied two language models to measure the phraseness and informativeness of phrases. Liu et al. (2011) share the most similar idea to our work. They used a word alignment model, which learns the translation from the documents to the keyphrases. This approach alleviates the problem of vocabulary gap between source and target to a certain degree. However, this translation model can hardly deal with semantic meaning. Additionally, they trained the model with the target of title/summary to enlarge the number of training samples, which may diverge away from the real objective of generating keyphrases."

(2014) to solve translation problems. As it provides a powerful tool for modeling variable-length sequence in an end-to-end fashion, it fits many Natural Language Processing tasks and soon achieves great successes (Rush et al., 2015; Vinyals et al., 2015; Serban et al., 2016).\nDifferent strategies have been explored to improve the performance of Encoder-Decoder model. The attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al.,\n2014) is a soft alignment approach that allows the model to automatically locate the relevant input component. In order to make use of the important information in the source text, some studies sought ways to copy certain parts of content from the source text and paste them into target text (Allamanis et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2016). There exists a discrepancy between the optimizing objective during training and the metrics during evaluation. A few studies attempted to eliminate this discrepancy by incorporating new training algorithm (Marc’Aurelio Ranzato et al., 2016) or modifying optimizing objective(Shen et al., 2016)."

Both the source text x(i) and keyphrase p(i,j) are sequences of words:\nx(i) = x (i) 1 , x (i) 2 , . . . , x (i) L xi\np(i,j) = y (i,j) 1 , y (i,j) 2 , . . . , y (i,j) L p(i,j)\nLx(i) and Lp(i,j)denotes the length of word sequence of x(i) and p(i,j) respectively.\nNow for each data sample, there are one source text sequence and multiple target phrase sequences. To apply the RNN Encoder-Decoder model, the data need to be converted into textkeyphrase pairs which contain only one source sequence and one target sequence. One simple way is to split the data sample (x(i),p(i)) intoMi pairs: (x(i),p(i,1)), (x(i),p(i,2)), . . . , (x(i),p(i,Mi)). Then the Encoder-Decoder model is ready to be applied to learn the mapping from source sequence to target sequence. For the purpose of simplicity, (x,y) is used to denote each data pair in the rest of this section, where x is the word sequence of a source text and y is the word sequence of its keyphrase."

      "text" : "The basic idea of our keyphrase generation model is to compress the content of source text into a hidden representation with encoder, and generate corresponding keyphrases by the decoder based on the representation . Both the encoder and decoder are implemented with recurrent neural networks (RNN).\nThe encoder RNN converts the variable-length input sequence x = (x1, x2, ..., xT ) into a set of hidden representation h = (h1, h2, . . . , hT ), by iterating the following equations along the time t:\nht = f (xt,ht−1) (1)\nwhere f is a non-linear function. And we get the context vector c, acting as the representation of the whole input x, through a non-linear function q.\nc = q(h1, h2, ..., hT ) (2)\nThe decoder is another RNN, decompresses the context vector and generates a variable-length sequence y = (y1, y2, ..., yT ′) word by word, through a conditional language model:\nst = g(yt−1, st−1, c) p(yt|y1,...,t−1,x) = g(yt−1, st, c) (3)\nwhere st is the hidden state of decoder RNN at time t. The non-linear function g is a softmax classifier which outputs the probabilities of all the words in the vocabulary. yt is the predicted word at time t, by taking the word with largest probability after g(·).\nThe encoder and decoder networks are trained jointly to maximize the conditional probability of the target sequence given a source sequence. After training, we use the beam search to generate phrases and a max heap is maintained to get the predictions with highest probabilities."

Previous studies (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) indicate it can provide a general better performance language modeling than simple RNN and a simpler structure than Long Short-term Memory Networks(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). So the above non-linear function f is replaced by the GRU function (see in (Cho et al., 2014)).\nAnother forward GRU is utilized as the decoder. In addition, an attention mechanism is adopted to improve the performance. The attention mechanism was firstly introduced by Bahdanau et al. (2014) to make the model focus on the important parts in input dynamically. The context vector c is computed as a weighted sum of hidden representation h = (h1, . . . , hT ):\nci = T∑ j=1 αijhj αij = exp(a(si−1, hj))∑T k=1 exp(a(si−1, hk))\n(4)\nwhere a(si−1, hj) is a soft alignment function that measures the similarity between si−1 and hj , namely to which degree the inputs around position j and the output at position i match."

      "heading" : "3.4 Copy Mechanism",
      "text" : "To ensure the quality of learned representation and reduce the size of vocabulary, typically the RNN model only considers a certain number of frequent words (e.g. 30,000 words in (Cho et al., 2014)), but a large amount of long-tail words are simply ignored. Therefore the RNN is not able to predict any keyphrase which contains out-of-vocabulary words. Actually, the important phrases can also be identified by their syntactic and location features, even though we don’t know the meanings. The copy mechanism is one feasible solution that enables RNN to predict unknown words based on contextual features.\nBy incorporating the copy mechanism, the probability of predicting each new word yt would consist of two parts. The first term is the probability of generating the term (see Equation 3) and the second one is the probability of copying it from source text:\np(yt|y1,...,t−1,x) = pg(yt|y1,...,t−1,x) + pc(yt|y1,...,t−1,x) (5)\nSimilar to attention mechanism, the copy mechanism pinpoints the appearance of yt−1 in source text, and use its location information (ρtτ ) to compute the weighted hidden representation (ζ(yt−1)) of input x.\nζ(yt−1) = TS∑ τ=1 ρtτhτ (6)\nρtτ = { 1 K p(xτ , c|st−1) xτ = yt−1 0 Otherwise\n(7)\nwhere K is the normalization term. Subsequently, we obtain the probabilities of copying pc(yt|y1,...,t−1) following the Equation 3, in which the target words are replaced by the words in source text, and the vector of yt−1 is replaced by [e(yt−1), ζ(yt−1)]\nT , where the e(yt−1) is the embedding of last predicted word."

To make a fair comparison, we only consider the present keyphrases for evaluation in this task. Table 2 provides the performances of the six baseline models, as well as our proposed models (i.e., RNN and CopyRNN). For each method, the table lists its F-measure at top 5 and top 10 predictions on the five datasets. The best scores are highlighted in bold and the underlines indicate the second best performances.\nThe results show that the four unsupervised models (Tf-idf, TextTank, SingleRank and ExpandRank) perform robust across different datasets. The ExpandRank fails to return any result on the KP20k dataset due to its high time com-\nplexity. The measures on NUS and SemEval here are higher than the ones reported in (Hasan and Ng, 2010) and (Kim et al., 2010), probably because we utilized the paper abstract instead of the full-text for training, which may filter out some noisy information. The performances of the two supervised models (i.e., Maui and KEA) are unstable on some datasets, but Maui achieves the best performances on three datasets among all the baseline models.\nAs for our proposed keyphrase prediction approaches, the RNN model with the attention mechanism does not perform as well as we expected. It might be because the RNN model only concerns on finding the hidden semantics behind the text, which may tend to generate keyphrases or words that are too general and may not necessarily referring to the source text. In addition, it fails to recall keyphrases that contain out-of-vocabulary words (since the RNN model only takes the top 50,000 words in vocabulary). This indicates that a pure generative model may not fit the extraction task, and we need to further link back to the language usage in the source text. Indeed, the copyRNN model, by considering more contextual information, significantly outperforms not only the RNN model but also all baselines, exceeding the best baselines by more than 20% on average. This result demonstrates the importance of source text for extraction task. Besides, nearly 2% of all the correct predictions contain out-of-vocabulary words.\nThe example in Figure 1(a) shows the result of predicted present keyphrases by RNN and CopyRNN for an article about video search. We see that both models can generate phrases that related to the topic of information retrieval and video. However most of RNN predictions are high-level terminologies, which are too general to be selected as keyphrases. The CopyRNN, on the other hand, predicts more detailed phrases like “video metadata” and “integrated ranking”. An interesting bad case is, “rich content” is coordinate with a keyphrase “video metadata”, and the CopyRNN puts it into prediction mistakenly."

Therefore, we only provide the RNN and copyRNN performances in the discussion of the results of this task. Here, we evaluate the performance with the recall of top 10 and top 50 results, to see how many absent keyphrases can be correctly predicted. We use the absent keyphrases in the testing datasets for evaluation.\nTable 3 present the recalls of the top 10/50 predicted keyphrases for our RNN and CopyRNN models, in which we observe that the CopyRNN can, on average, recall around 8% (15%) of keyphrases at top 10 (50) predictions. This indicates that, to some extent, both models can capture the hidden semantics behind the textual content and make reasonable predictions. In addition, with the advantage of features from the source text, the CopyRNN model also outperforms the RNN model in this condition, though not improve as much as the present keyphrase extraction task. An example is shown in Figure 1(b), in which we see that two absent keyphrases “video retrieval” and “video indexing” are correctly recalled by both models. The interesting thing is, the term “indexing” does not appear in the text, but the models\nmay detect the information “index videos” in the first sentence and paraphrase it to the target phrase.

We believe that the models have a greater potential to be generalized to other domains and types, like books, online reviews etc., if it is trained on larger data corpus. Also, we directly apply our model, which is trained on publication dataset, into generating keyphrases for news articles without any adaptive training. We believe that with proper training on news data, the\nmodel would make further improvement. Additionally, this work mainly studies the problem of discovering core content from textual materials.

Though previous studies have provided many workable solutions for automated keyphrase extraction, they commonly divide the to-besummarized content into multiple text chunks, then rank and select the most meaningful ones. These approaches can neither identify keyphrases that do not appear in the text, nor capture the real semantic meaning behind the text. We propose a generative model for keyphrase prediction with an encoder-decoder framework, which can effectively overcome the above drawbacks. We name it as deep keyphrase generation since it attempts to capture the deep semantic meaning of content with a deep learning method. Empirical analysis on six datasets demonstrates that our proposed model not only achieves a significant performance boost on extracting keyphrases that appear in the source text, but also generates absent keyphrases based on the semantic meaning of the text.",
