      "text" : "Sememes are defined as minimum semantic units of word meanings, and there exists a limited close set of sememes to compose the semantic meanings of an open set of concepts (i.e. word sense). However, sememes are not explicit for each word. Hence, people manually annotate word sememes and build linguistic common-sense\nknowledge bases. HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2003) is one of such knowledge bases, which annotates each concepts in Chinese with one or more relevant sememes. Different from WordNet (Miller, 1995), the philosophy of HowNet emphasizes the significance of part and attribute represented by sememes. HowNet has been widely utilized in word similarity computation (Liu and Li, 2002) and sentiment analysis (Xianghua et al., 2013), and in section 3.2 we will give detailed introduction on sememes, senses and words in HowNet.\nIn this paper, we aim to incorporate word sememes into word representation learning (WRL) and learn improved word embeddings in a lowdimensional semantic space. WRL is a fundamental and critical step in many NLP tasks such as language modeling (Bengio et al., 2003) and neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014).\nThere have been a lot of researches for learning word representations, among which word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) achieves a nice balance between effectiveness and efficiency. In word2vec, each word corresponds to one single embedding, ignoring the polysemy of most words. To address this issue, (Huang et al., 2012) introduces multiprototype model for WRL, conducting unsupervised word sense induction and embeddings according to context clusters. (Chen et al., 2014) further utilizes the synset information in WordNet to instruct word sense representation learning.\nFrom these previous studies we conclude that, word sense disambiguation are critical for WRL, and we believe that the sememe annotation of word senses in HowNet can provide essential semantic regularization for the both tasks. To explore its feasibility, we propose a novel Sememe-Encoded Word Representation Learning (SE-WRL) model, which detects word senses and learns representations simultaneously. More\nspecifically, this framework regards each word sense as a combination of its sememes, and iteratively performs word sense disambiguation according to their contexts and learn representations of sememes, senses and words by extending Skipgram in word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013). In this framework, an attention-based method is proposed to automatically select appropriate word senses according to contexts. To take full advantages of sememes, we propose three different learning and attention strategies for SE-WRL.\nIn experiments, we evaluate our framework on two tasks including word similarity and word analogy, and further conduct case studies on sememe, sense and word representations. The evaluation results show that our models outperform other baselines significantly, especially on word analogy. This indicates that our models can automatically detect appropriate word senses according to contexts, and both word sense disambiguation and representation learning can benefit from the sememe annotation in HowNet.\nThe key contributions of this work are concluded as follows: (1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize sememes in HowNet to improve word representation learning. (2) We successfully apply the attention scheme to detect word senses and learn representations according to contexts with the favor of the sememe annotation in HowNet. (3) We conduct extensive experiments and verify the effectiveness of incorporating word sememes for improved WRL."

      "heading" : "2.1 Word Representation",
      "text" : "Recent years have witnessed the great thrive in word representation learning. It is simple and straightforward to represent words using one-hot representations, but it usually struggles with the data sparsity issue and the neglect of semantic relations between words.\nTo address these issues, (Rumelhart et al., 1988) proposes the idea of distributed representation which projects all words into a continuous low-dimensional semantic space, considering each word as a vector. Distributed word representations are powerful and have been widely utilized in many NLP tasks, including neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2010), machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015), parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014)\nand text classification (Zhang et al., 2015). Word distributed representations are capable of encoding semantic meanings in vector space, serving as the fundamental and essential inputs of many NLP tasks.\nThere are large amounts of efforts devoted to learning better word representations. As the exponential growth of text corpora, model efficiency becomes an important issue. (Mikolov et al., 2013) proposes two models, CBOW and Skipgram, achieving a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency. These models assume that the meanings of words can be well reflected by their contexts, and learn word representations by maximizing the predictive probabilities between words and their contexts. (Pennington et al., 2014) further utilizes matrix factorization on word affinity matrix to learn word representations. However, these models merely arrange only one vector for each word, regardless of the fact that many words have multiple senses. (Huang et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2014) utilize multi-prototype vector models to learn word representations, and build distinct vectors for each word sense. (Neelakantan et al., 2015) presents an extension to Skip-gram model for learning non-parametric multiple embeddings per word. (Rothe and Schütze, 2015) also utilizes an Autoencoder to jointly learn word, sense and synset representations in the same semantic space.\nThis paper, for the first time, jointly learns representations of sememes, senses and words. The sememe annotation in HowNet provides useful semantic regularization for WRL. Moreover, the unified representations incorporated with sememes also provide us more explicit explanations of both word and sense embeddings."

      "heading" : "2.2 Word Sense Disambiguation and Representation Learning",
      "text" : "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) aims to computationally identify word senses or meanings in a certain context. There are mainly two approaches for WSD, namely the supervised methods and the knowledge-based methods. Supervised methods usually take the surrounding words or senses as features and use classifiers like SVM for word sense disambiguation (Lee et al., 2004), which are intensively limited to the time-consuming human annotation of training data.\nOn contrary, knowledge-based methods utilize large external knowledge resources such as knowl-\nedge bases or dictionaries to suggest possible senses for a word. (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002) exploits the rich hierarchy of semantic relations in WordNet (Miller, 1995) for an adapted dictionarybased WSD algorithm. (Bordes et al., 2011) introduces synset information in WordNet to WRL. (Chen et al., 2014) considers synsets in WordNet as different word senses, and jointly conducts word sense disambiguation and word / sense representation learning. (Guo et al., 2014) considers bilingual datasets to learn sense-specific word representations. Moreover, (Jauhar et al., 2015) proposes two approaches to learn sense-specific word representations that are grounded to ontologies. (Pilehvar and Collier, 2016) utilizes personalized PageRank to learn de-conflated semantic representations of words.\nIn this paper, we follow the knowledge-based approach and automatically detect word senses according to the contexts with the favor of sememe information in HowNet. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply attentionbased models to encode sememe information for word representation learning."

      "text" : "In this section, we first introduce the arrangement of sememes, senses and words in HowNet. HowNet annotates precise senses to each word, and for each sense HowNet annotates the significance of parts and attributes represented by sememes.\nFig. 1 gives an example of sememes, senses and words in HowNet. The first layer represents the word “apple”. The word “apple” actually has two\nmain senses shown on the second layer: one is a sort of juicy fruit (apple), and another is a famous computer brand (Apple brand). The third and following layers are those sememes explaining each sense. For instance, the first sense Apple brand indicates a computer brand, and thus has sememes computer, bring and SpeBrand.\nFrom Fig. 1 we can find that, sememes of many senses in HowNet are annotated with various relations, such as define and modifier, and form complicated hierarchical structures. In this paper, for simplicity we only consider all annotated sememes of each sense as a sememe set without considering their internal structure. HowNet assumes the limited annotated sememes can well represent senses and words in real-world scenario, and thus sememes are expected to be useful for both WSD and WRL.\nWe introduce the notions utilized in the following sections as follows. We define the overall sememe, sense and word sets used in training as X , S and W respectively. For each w ∈ W , there are possible multiple senses s(w)i ∈ S(w) where S(w) represents the sense set ofw. Each sense s(w)i consists of several sememes x(si)j ∈ X (w) i . For each target word w in a sequential plain text, C(w) represents its context word set."

      "text" : "We directly utilize the widely-used model Skipgram to implement our SE-WRL model, because Skip-gram has well balanced effectiveness as well as efficiency (Mikolov et al., 2013). The standard skip-gram model assumes that word embeddings should relate to their context words. It aims at maximizing the predictive probability of context words conditioned on the target word w. For-\nmally, we utilize a sliding window to select the context word set C(w). For a word sequence H = {w1, · · · , wn}, Skip-gram model intends to maximize:\nL(H) = n−K∑ i=K log Pr(wi−K , · · · , wi+K |wi), (1)\nwhere K is the size of sliding window. Pr(wi−K , · · · , wi+K |wi) represents the predictive probability of context words conditioned on the target word wi, formalized by the following softmax function:\nPr(wi−K , · · · , wi+K |wi) = ∏\nwc∈C(wi)\nPr(wc|wi)\n= ∏\nwc∈C(wi)\nexp(w>c ·wi)∑ w′i∈W exp(w>c ·w′i) ,\n(2)\nin which wc and wi stand for embeddings of context word wc ∈ C(wi) and target word wi respectively. We can also follow the strategies of hierarchical softmax and negative sampling proposed in (Mikolov et al., 2013) to accelerate the calculation of softmax."

For each word, SSA considers all sememes in all senses of the word together, and represents the target word using the average of all its sememe embeddings. Formally, we have:\nw = 1\nm ∑ s (w) i ∈S(w) ∑ x (si) j ∈X (w) i x (si) j , (3)\nwhich means the word embedding of w is composed by the average of all its sememe embeddings. Here, m stands for the overall number of sememes belonging to w.\nThis model simply follows the assumption that, the semantic meaning of a word is composed by\nthe semantic units, i.e., sememes. As compared to the conventional Skip-gram model, since sememes are shared by multiple words, this model can utilize sememe information to encode latent semantic correlations between words. In this case, similar words that share the same sememes may finally obtain similar representations."

      "heading" : "3.3.2 Sememe Attention over Context Model",
      "text" : "The SSA Model replaces the target word embedding with the aggregated sememe embeddings to encode sememe information into word representation learning. However, each word in SSA model still has only one single representation in different contexts, which cannot deal with polysemy of most words. It is intuitive that we should construct distinct embeddings for a target word according to specific contexts, with the favor of word sense annotation in HowNet.\nTo address this issue, we come up with the Sememe Attention over Context Model (SAC). SAC utilizes the attention scheme to automatically select appropriate senses for context words according to the target word. That is, SAC conducts word sense disambiguation for context words to learn better representations of target words. The structure of the SAC model is shown in Fig. 2.\nMore specifically, we utilize the original word embedding for target word w, but use sememe embeddings to represent context word wc instead of original context word embeddings. Suppose a word typically demonstrates some specific senses in one sentence. Here we employ the target word embedding as an attention to select the most appropriate senses to make up context word embeddings. We formalize the context word embedding wc as follows:\nwc = |S(wc)|∑ j=1 att(s (wc) j ) · s (wc) j , (4)\nwhere s(wc)j stands for the j-th sense embedding ofwc, and att(s (wc) j ) represents the attention score of the j-th sense with respect to the target word w, defined as follows:\natt(s (wc) j ) = exp(w · ŝ(wc)j )∑|S(wc)| k=1 exp(w · ŝ (wc) k ) . (5)\nNote that, when calculating attention, we use the average of sememe embeddings to represent each sense s(wc)j :\nŝ (wc) j =\n1\n|X(wc)j | |X(wc)j |∑ k=1 x (sj) k .\n(6)\nThe attention strategy assumes that, the more relevant a context word sense embedding is to the target word w, the more this sense should be considered when building context word embeddings. With the favor of attention scheme, we can represent each context word as a certain distribution over its sense. This can be regarded as soft WSD. As shown in experiments, it will help learn better word representations."

Hence SAT is expected to conduct more reliable WSD and result in more accurate word representations, which will be explored in experiments."

GloVe is proposed by (Pennington et al., 2014), which seeks the advantages of the WRL models based on statistics and those based on prediction. Moreover, we implement another baseline Maximum Selection over Target Model (MST) inspired by (Chen et al., 2014). It represents the current word embeddings with only the most probable sense according to the contexts, instead of viewing a word as a certain distribution over all its senses similar to that of SAT.\nFor a fair comparison, we train these models with the same experimental settings and with their best parameters. As for the parameter settings, we set the context window size K = 8 as the upper bound, and during training the window size is dynamically selected ranging from 1 to 8 randomly.

In general, SSA model performs slightly better than baselines, which tentatively proves that sememe information is helpful. The reason is that words which share common sememe embeddings will benefit from each other. Especially, those words with lower frequency, which cannot be learned sufficiently using conventional WRL models, in contrast can obtain better word embeddings from SSA simply because their sememe embeddings can be trained sufficiently through other words.\n(3) The SAT model performs much better than SSA and SAC. This indicates that SAT can obtain more precise sense distribution of a word. The reason has been mentioned above that, different from\nSAC using only one target word as attention for WSD, SAT adopts richer contextual information as attention for WSD.\n(4) SAT works better than MST, and we can conclude that, a soft disambiguation over senses prevents inevitable errors when selecting only one most-probable sense. The result makes sense because for many words, their various senses are not always completely different from each other, but share some common elements.

Given an analogy group of words (w1, w2, w3, w4), WRL models usually get w2−w1+w3 equal to w4. Hence for word analogy inference, we suppose w4 is missing, and WRL models will rank all candidate words according to their scores as follows:\nR(w) = cos(w2 −w1 +w3,w), (10)\nand select the top-ranked word as the answer. For word analogy inference, we consider two evaluation metrics: (1) Accuracy. For each analogy group, a WRL model selects the top-ranked word w = argmaxw R(w), which is judged as positive if w = w4. The percentage of positive samples is regarded as the accuracy score for this WRL model. (2) Mean Rank.

From the table, we can observe that:\n(1) The SAT model performs best among all models, and the superiority is more significant than that on word similarity computation. This indicates that SAT will enhance the modeling of implicit relations between word embeddings in the semantic space. The reason is that sememes annotated to word senses have encoded these word relations. For example, capital and Cuba are two sememes of the word “Havana”, which provide explicit semantic relations between the words “Cuba” and “Havana”.\n(2) The SAT model does well on both classes of Capital and City, because some words in these classes have low frequencies, while their sememes occur so many times that sememe embeddings can be learned sufficiently. With these sememe embeddings, these low-frequent words can be learned more efficiently by SAT.\n(3) It seems that CBOW works better than SAT on Relationship class. Whereas for the mean rank, CBOW gets the worst results, which indicates the performance of CBOW is unstable. On the contrary, although the accuracy of SAT is a bit lower than that of CBOW, SAT seldom gives outrageous prediction. In most wrong cases, SAT predicts the word “grandfather” instead of “grandmother”, which is not completely non-sense, because in HowNet the words “grandmother”, “grandfather”, “grandma” and some other similar words share four common sememes while only one sememe of them are different. These similar sememes make the attention process less discriminative with each other. But for the wrong cases\nof CBOW, we find that many mistakes are about words with low frequencies, such as “stepdaughter” which occurs merely for 358 times. With the help of sememes, these low-frequency words arise no issue for SAT."

In this paper, we present that, word sememe information can improve word representation learning (WRL), which maps words into a low-dimensional semantic space and serves as a fundamental step for many NLP tasks. The key idea is to utilize word sememes to accurately capture exact meanings of a word within specific contexts. More specifically, we follow the framework of Skip-gram and present three sememe-encoded models to learn representations of sememes, senses and words, where we apply the attention scheme to detect word senses in various contexts. We conduct experiments on two tasks including word similarity and word analogy, and our models significantly outperform baselines. The results indicate that WRL can benefit from sememes via the attention scheme, and also confirm our models being capable of properly modeling sememe information.",
