      "text" : "Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is a preliminary and important task for Chinese natural language processing (NLP). Currently, the state-ofthe-art methods are based on statistical supervised learning algorithms (Xue, 2003; Zhao et al., 2006), and rely on a large-scale annotated corpus whose cost is extremely expensive. Although there have been great achievements in building CWS corpora, they are somewhat incompatible due to different segmentation criteria. As shown in Table 1, given a sentence “姚明进入总决赛 (YaoMing reaches the final)”, the two commonly-used corpora, PKU’s People’s Daily (PKU) (Yu et al., 2001) and Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xia, 2000), use different segmentation criteria. In a sense, it is a waste of resources if we fail to fully exploit these corpora. Recently, some efforts have been made to exploit heterogeneous annotation data for Chinese word segmentation or part-of-speech tagging\n(Jiang et al., 2009; Sun and Wan, 2012; Qiu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015). These methods adopted stacking or multi-task architectures and showed that heterogeneous corpora can help each other. However, most of these model adopt the shallow linear classifier with discrete features, which makes it difficult to design the shared feature spaces, usually resulting in a complex model. Fortunately, recent deep neural models provide a convenient way to share information among multiple tasks (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Luong et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016). In this paper, we propose an adversarial multicriteria learning for CWS by integrating shared knowledge from multiple segmentation criteria. Specifically, we regard each segmentation criterion as a single task and propose three different shared-private models under the framework of multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997; Ben-David and Schuller, 2003), where a shared layer is used to extract the criteria-invariant features, and a private layer is used to extract the criteria-specific features. Inspired by the success of adversarial strategy on domain adaption (Ajakan et al., 2014; Ganin et al., 2016; Bousmalis et al., 2016), we further utilize adversarial strategy to make sure the shared layer can extract the common underlying and criteria-invariant features, which are suitable for all the criteria. Finally, we exploit the eight segmentation criteria on the five simplified Chinese and three traditional Chinese corpora. Experiments show that our models are effective to improve the performance for CWS. We also observe\nthat traditional Chinese could benefit from incorporating knowledge from simplified Chinese. The contributions of this paper could be summarized as follows.\n• Multi-criteria learning is first introduced for CWS, in which we propose three sharedprivate models to integrate multiple segmentation criteria. • An adversarial strategy is used to force the shared layer to learn criteria-invariant features, in which an new objective function is also proposed instead of the original crossentropy loss. • We conduct extensive experiments on eight CWS corpora with different segmentation criteria, which is by far the largest number of datasets used simultaneously."

      "text" : "Chinese word segmentation task is usually regarded as a character based sequence labeling problem. Specifically, each character in a sentence is labeled as one of L = {B,M,E, S}, indicating the begin, middle, end of a word, or a word with single character. There are lots of prevalent methods to solve sequence labeling problem such as maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM), conditional random fields (CRF), etc. Recently, neural networks are widely applied to Chinese word segmentation task for their ability to minimize the effort in feature engineering (Zheng et al., 2013; Pei et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Ma and Hinrichs, 2015; Xu and Sun, 2016; Yao and Huang, 2016; Cai and Zhao, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). Specifically, given a sequence with n characters X = {x1, . . . , xn}, the aim of CWS task is to figure out the ground truth of labels Y ∗ = {y∗1, . . . , y∗n}:\nY ∗ = argmax Y ∈Ln p(Y |X), (1)\nwhere L = {B,M,E, S}. The general architecture of neural CWS could be characterized by three components: (1) a character embedding layer; (2) feature layers consisting of several classical neural networks and (3) a tag inference layer. The role of feature layers is to extract features, which could be either convolution neural network or recurrent neural network. In this paper, we employ the state-of-the-art architecture\n(Huang et al., 2015; Ma and Hovy, 2016) which adopts the bi-direction long short-term memory with CRF as tag inference layer. Figure 1 illustrates the general architecture of CWS."

Formally, LSTM, with input gate i, output gate o, forget gate f and memory cell c, could be expressed as:\nii oi fi c̃i  =  σ σ σ ϕ (Wgᵀ [ exihi−1 ] + bg ) , (2)\nci = ci−1 ⊙ fi + c̃i ⊙ ii, (3) hi = oi ⊙ ϕ(ci), (4)\nwhere Wg ∈ R(de+dh)×4dh and bg ∈ R4dh are trainable parameters. dh is a hyper-parameter, in-\ndicating the hidden state size.

To exploit the shared information between these different criteria, we propose three sharing models for CWS task as shown in Figure 2. The feature layers of these three models consist of a private (criterion-specific) layer and a shared (criterioninvariant) layer. The difference between three models is the information flow between the task layer and the shared layer. Besides, all of these three models also share the embedding layer."

Inspired by the work on domain adaptation (Ajakan et al., 2014; Ganin et al., 2016; Bousmalis et al., 2016), we hope that the features extracted by shared layer is invariant across the heterogonous segmentation criteria. Therefore, we jointly optimize the shared\nlayer via adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Therefore, besides the task loss for CWS, we additionally introduce an adversarial loss to prevent criterion-specific feature from creeping into shared space as shown in Figure 3. We use a criterion discriminator which aims to recognizewhich criterion the sentence is annotated by using the shared features. Specifically, given a sentence X with length n, we refer to h(s)X as shared features for X in one of the sharing models. Here, we compute h(s)X by simply averaging the hidden states of shared layer h(s)X = 1 n ∑n i h (s) xi . The criterion discriminator computes the probability p(·|X) over all criteria as:\np(·|X; Θd,Θs) = softmax(W⊤d h (s) X + bd), (19)\nwhereΘd indicates the parameters of criterion discriminator Wd ∈ Rdh×M and bd ∈ RM ; Θs denotes the parameters of shared layers."

(1) In the first block, we can see that the performance of Bi-LSTM cannot be improved by merely increasing the depth of networks. (2) In the second block, our proposed threemodels based on multi-criteria learning boost performance. Model-I gains 0.75% improvement on averaging F-measure score compared with Bi-LSTM result (94.14%). Only the performance on MSRA drops slightly. Compared to the baseline results (Bi-LSTM and stacked Bi-LSTM), the proposed models boost the performance with the help of exploiting information across these heterogeneous segmentation criteria. Although various criteria have different segmentation granularities, there are still some underlying information shared. For instance, MSRA and CTB treat family name and last name as one token “宁泽涛 (NingZeTao)”, whereas some other datasets, like PKU, regard them as two tokens, “宁 (Ning)” and “泽涛 (ZeTao)”. The partial boundaries (before “宁 (Ning)” or after “涛 (Tao)”) can be shared. (3) In the third block, we introduce adversarial training. By introducing adversarial training, the performances are further boosted, and Model-I is slightly better than Model-II and Model-III. The adversarial training tries to make shared layer keep\ncriteria-invariant features. For instance, as shown in Table 4, when we use shared information, the performance onMSRA drops (worse than baseline result). The reason may be that the shared parameters bias to other segmentation criteria and introduce noisy features into shared parameters. When we additionally incorporate the adversarial strategy, we observe that the performance on MSRA is improved and outperforms the baseline results. We could also observe the improvements on other datasets. However, the boost from the adversarial strategy is not significant. The main reason might be that the proposed three sharing models implicitly attempt to keep invariant features by shared parameters and learn discrepancies by the task layer."

Table 5 gives the results of Model-I on 3 traditional Chinese datasets under the help of 5 simplified Chinese datasets. Specifically, we firstly train the model on simplified Chinese datasets, then we train traditional Chinese datasets independently with shared parameters fixed. As we can see, the average performance is boosted by 0.41% on F-measure score (from 93.78% to 94.19%), which indicates that shared features learned from simplified Chinese segmentation criteria can help to improve performance on traditional Chinese. Like MSRA, as AS dataset is relatively large (train set of 5.4M tokens), the features learned by shared parameters might bias to other datasets and thus hurt performance on such large dataset AS."

As the proposed models and the baseline models (Bi-LSTM and stacked Bi-LSTM) are nearly in the same complexity, all models are nearly the\nsame efficient. However, the time consumption of training process varies from model to model. For the models without adversarial training, it costs about 10 hours for training (the same for stacked Bi-LSTM to train eight datasets), whereas it takes about 16 hours for the models with adversarial training.

Most existingmethods focus on improve the performance for each single criterion. However, it is interesting to exploit these different criteria and mining their common underlying knowledge. In this paper, we propose adversarial multi-criteria learning for CWS by integrating shared knowledge frommultiple heterogeneous segmentation criteria. Experiments on eight corpora with heterogeneous segmentation criteria show that the performance of each corpus obtains a significant improvement, compared to single-criterion learning.",
