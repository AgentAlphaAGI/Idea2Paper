      "text" : "Causation is a psychological tool of humans to understand the world independently of language, and it is one of the principles involved in the construction of the human mental model of reality (Neeleman and van de Koot, 2012). Causal reasoning is the process of relating two events, namely cause and its effect. Following the words of Reinhart (2002), causal relations are imposed by humans on the input from the world, and the (computational) linguist’s task is to understand what is about language that enables speakers to use it to describe their causal perceptions.\nThere are different theories concerning how natural language approximates causation. Those theories based on generative semantics argue that the causal relation is encoded in the semantics of some verbs (Lakoff, 1970; McCawley, 1976) or in the syntactic structure of a sentence (Dowty, 1979; Ramchand, 2008). For instance, Pylkkänen (2008) argues that the causing event may be associated with the subject of the causal verb in a causal predicate. This principle is true in the sentence “Pe-\nter eventually killed John by hitting him with a hammer”, in which the event of Peter hitting John with a hammer caused the death of John. But, the following sentence can be used as a counterexample: “A hammer eventually killed John”. In the later sentence the subject of “killed” is the “hammer”, which does not constitute a causing event for the event “kill John”. Therefore, the syntaxgrounded construction of causality defined by those theories is far away from the human mental model of causation. Indeed, Neeleman and van de Koot (2012) showed that the later approaches cannot be proven by standard syntactic tests, because neither the causing event nor causal relation correspond to a syntactic constituent. Neeleman and van de Koot (2012) concluded that the linguistic approximation of causation by culmination of events is not exclusive of causal verbs, and it is also found in non-causative verb classes.\nCausation or causality has also been studied in computational linguistics. There are some semantic and discourse resources that take into account causality in the range of linguistic phenomena that they annotate. PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) is a semantic resource that annotates the argument structure of verbs. The type of causation annotated in PropBank is related to the syntax and semantics of the verbs. For the sentences John broke the window and “The hammer broke the window”, “John” and “the hammer” are the cause arguments of the verb “broke”. Although, “John” and “the hammer” are required arguments for the event expressed by “break”, they do not represent the causing event of the window breaking event.\nCausality is one of the discourse relations in Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008). Causality is annotated in PDTB as either an explicit or an implicit relation between events. When causality is explicit, it is signalled by a lexical marker such as because or since between others.\nHowever, there are some scenarios where the causal discourse relation is not signalled by a known lexical marker, but by other expressions that are called Alternative Lexicalizations (AltLex). The existence of AltLex means that the expression of causality is not defined by a limited number of lexical constructions, so the coverage of the total number of possible causal expressions is restricted to the grade of coverage of the base corpus of PDTB.\nThe previous paragraphs and the works described in Section 2 show that causality is driven by a limited set of lexical elements and syntactic constructions. However, causality does not have a fixed list of lexical or syntactic constructions. Hidey and McKeown (2016) stressed the issue of the limited coverage of causal expressions and released a corpus with a larger amount of causal expressions than PDTB. They also proposed a classification method, which is based on the use of features from the corpus and features from lexical resources. The last set of features reduces the ability of the system to classify causality, because they restrict the system to the causal definition of the lexical resources.\nCausal meaning disambiguation is the task of identifying whether there is a causal relation between two events. We hypothesize that neural networks are able to encode the meaning of those events, and discover whether the underlying relation between them is causal. Herein, we contribute a neural network architecture for the task of causality disambiguation and we assess it in the corpus of Hidey and McKeown (2016). Empiric results on this corpus show that our claim indeed holds."

      "text" : "Khoo et al. (1998) presented one of the first works related to the classification of causal relations. The authors defined a set of linguistic rules for the identification of cause-effect relations, and developed a pattern matching system based on those rules. The errors of the system show the common errors of a full linguistically grounded classification system, which are related to the ambiguity of some causal links such as by or as or the lexical and syntactic ambiguity of some causative verbs. Those errors are related to the lack of evidence of the syntax basis of causation (Neeleman and van de Koot, 2012).\nGirju (2003) proposed a decision tree learning method to classify causal relations between events. The type of relations studied by the author are those conveyed by a verb and two noun phrases. The clas-\nsification method uses as lexical features whether the verb of the sentence belongs to a list of ambiguous causative verbs, and whether the nouns belongs to one of the nine semantic hierarchies in WordNet. Again, the main source of errors is the ambiguity of the projection of causality in natural language.\nBethard and Martin (2008) defined a method for the classification of causal relations between verbal events in conjunction constructions, namely conjoined events. Since the method was defined for a specific kind of causal relation between events, the authors had to first create a corpus following that requirement. The authors developed a supervised classification system using syntactic and semantic features from WordNet, and they used SVM as a classification algorithm. The drawback of the method is its reduced flexibility, because it is only defined for a specific causal construction and its confidence in syntactic features. Moreover, the authors conclude that semantic features are more adequate for causality classification than syntactic features, which goes in the direction of our claim.\nThe first attempt of encoding the contextual information for causality classification between events is found in Do et al. (2011). The authors defined a measure of the causality relation between two events according to the co-occurrence frequency between the predicates and their arguments. The measure is inspired by the causality score defined by Riaz and Girju (2010).\nFollowing the work of Do et al. (2011), Riaz and Girju (2013, 2014) built a knowledge base for causal events, first for events related by a pair of verbs, and then for events conveyed by pairs of verbs and noun phrases. In these works, the authors attempted to go in the direction of using distributional semantics in order to encode the causal meaning, but they still rely on the use of lexical and syntactic features. Thus, the main drawbacks of those papers are the complex featuring engineering process to detect the causal relation, and the restricted coverage of the resulting knowledge bases.\nFollowing the previous approaches, Mirza and Tonelli (2016) described a causal classification system built upon a rule based system and a machine learning algorithm based on lexical, syntactic and semantic features. The novelty lies in the use of features of temporal relations. The work of Mirza and Tonelli (2016) has similar issues to the work of (Bethard and Martin, 2008), because they use similar features to represent causality.\nThe previous works support the idea that causality is defined by a specific syntactic construction or the semantics of verbs known as causative verbs. On the other hand, some of the works restricted their study to a narrow kind of syntactic constructions, such as the conjoined events of Bethard and Martin (2008). In contrast, we argue that the representation of causality should not be limited by syntactic patterns or the coverage of semantic resources, due to the lack of a particular linguistic construction for causality. Therefore, we propose the neural encoding of the context of the relation in order to disambiguate its causal meaning."

      "text" : "Causality is defined as the semantic relation between two events (e1, e2), namely causing event (cause, e1) and caused event (effect, e2). An event may be a verb, whose arguments may be explicitly present or not (subject, verb, object), or a noun phrase. The relation can be explicit or implicit, in case it is explicitly expressed, it is signalled by a lexical marker (l), which may be a verb, a preposition, an adverb or an expression such as as a result of, see Table 1.\nSome researchers impose two additional restrictions: the temporal restriction, which means that the causing event should take place before the caused event, and the counterfactual one, which says if the causing event did not occur, the caused event would not have occurred either. Thus, causation can be formally defined as e1 → e2. An example from the test set used in the experiments that follows the three restrictions is the following:\nA government affidavit in 2006 stated that (the leak)e1 (caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries)e2\nIt is evident that e1 is before e2 and if the leak did not occur, the set of events in e2 would not occur. Nevertheless, we support the same opinion as Neeleman and van de Koot (2012) and we do not add the counterfactual constraint in our definition, because it is not true in all the cases. For example:\n(The argument between John’s parents)e1 (broke the window)e2\nIf we follow the counterfactual constraint, the event of the argument between the John’s parents should be the causing event. However, the human mental model of causality does not usually relate an argument with the breaking of a window. Causation is concerned with the human understanding of the world and not with the world itself.\nConcerning the temporal restriction, it should be interpreted as a physical ordering constraint and not as a positional one. That means, the causing event does not always appear before the caused event in the sentence. The caused event (e2) is before the causing event (e1) in the following example:\n(This water was diverted)e2 ([due to]l a combination of improper maintenance, leaking and clogging, and eventually ended up in the MIC storage tank.)e1\nSome related work attempted to identify the causing, the caused event and its direction (Mirza and Tonelli, 2016), but for that purpose, they restricted the study to a specific syntactic construction. We claim that the task of causality classification has not to be restricted to a syntactic construction and it has to be set up as a two steps task: causal meaning classification and causal arguments identification. The task of causal meaning classification is a binary classification task that is defined as the disambiguation of the causal meaning of the relation of two events. The input of the task is two events and the output is the meaning of the relation (Causal or Non Causal). The task of causal argument identification is focused on the identification of the causing (e1) and caused (e2) events. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the first subtask, so given two events (e1, e2) and the expression susceptible of signalling causality (l), the system returns the meaning of the relation (Causal or Non Causal). The following sentence is an example of the input of our system.\n(He fell in love with her and changed his life)e1 ([so]l he could help her)e2\nSentence Meaning\nAn undercroft is traditionally a cellar or storage room, often brick-lined and vaulted, and used for storage in buildings since medieval times\nTemporal\nAdditionally if one is to use a large scan range then sensitivity of the instrument is decreased due to performing fewer scans per second since each scan will have to detect a wide range of mass fragments\nCausal\nIn stark contrast to his predecessor, five days after his election he spoke of his determination to do what he could to bring peace Temporal Bischoff in a round table discussion claimed he fired Austin after he refused to do a taping in Atlanta Causal\nTable 2: Examples of different meanings of the prepositions since and after taken from the AltLex corpus"

      "text" : "Causality may be signalled by a verb (cause), a preposition (because), an adverb (subsequently) or an expression such as as a result of. Some of those causal expressions are almost unambiguous, but the causal meaning of others totally depends on the context. For instance, according to PDTB, the preposition because is an unambiguous lexical marker of causation, but there are other expressions whose causal meaning is not unarguable, such as since or after that may have a temporal or a causal interpretation, see Table 2. Therefore, we need a corpus in which the events, the lexical marker and the meaning of the relation are annotated.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are three available corpora. The first one was exposed in Bethard and Martin (2008) and it is built on top of the Penn TreeBank corpus. The corpus only provides the position of the related events in each sentence and whether the relation is causal. Unfortunately, the corpus is not freely available, and is also not large enough to train neural methods.\nThe second corpus is Causal-TimeBank (Mirza et al., 2014), which is built on top of the TimeML corpus. Annotation was restricted to explicit causal relations. They followed the same annotation schema of TimeML, so they defined the label CSIGNAL for the causal lexical markers, and CLINK to mark the causal relation between two events. The authors manually annotated the causal relations between the identified events in TimeML. The fact that the causal lexical markers are annotated agrees with our data requirements, but as the previous corpus, Causal-TimeBank is too small to train neural methods.\nRecently, the AltLex corpus has been freely released (Hidey and McKeown, 2016). The corpus was built on the idea that causation can be expressed by different kinds of linguistic constructions. This is validated by the fact that in PDTB there are explicit causal lexical markers, and other sort of expressions that have a discourse meaning,\nwhich are called AltLex. The relations signalled by an AltLex expression are implicit relations, in which the annotator did not find an appropriate connective to insert between the events, because the meaning of the relation is entailed by other expressions, namely AltLex. Furthermore, some causal lexical markers can be perceived as variations of the basic ones, but those variations are not usually in the list of discourse connectives. Thus, the authors of the AltLex corpus decided to develop a method to identify a larger amount of AltLex expressions with causal meaning. The corpus construction leveraged Simple Wikipedia, by aligning sentences from Wikipedia that consist of unknown lexical causal markers with sentences from Simple Wikipedia that contain corresponding known lexical causal markers. Once a first set of causal and non-causal sentences were identified, a bootsrapping method was applied to enhance the corpus. We call “non bootstrapping” to the first version of the corpus and “bootstrapping” to the second one. The corpus size is shown in Table 3. For further details see (Hidey and McKeown, 2016).\nThe class distribution of the lexical markers should be studied, because one of the features of the corpus is the annotation of the lexical markers susceptible of expressing causation. Table 4 shows the class distribution of the lexical markers, as well as the the number of unarguable ones and the number of lexical markers with mostly a different meaning in the training and the test set. According to the Table 4, there are few ambiguous connectives, 121 in the “non bootstrapping” corpus and 147 in the “bootstrapping” version. However, there is an important difference between the two versions of\nthe corpus: there are no differences between the training and the test set in the “non bootstrapping” version, but there are in the “bootstrapping” one. This fact means that the “bootstrapping” version of the corpus has some instances that do not follow the class distribution of the training set, so they represent a higher difficulty for the classification system. Section 4.3 exposes the good performance of the proposed system in some of those instances."

      "text" : "Kruengkrai et al. (2017) describe a Multi-column Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that uses background knowledge for the identification of the causal meaning of an input sentence in Japanese. Convolutional networks excel at pattern learning in input data, however causation does not have a particular syntactic structure as it was mentioned. Moreover, CNN requires the definition of the kernel size, which means that we should know beforehand the length of the context that projects the causal meaning of the sentence. Nevertheless, the list of expressions that may represent a causal meaning is not limited and some sentences implicitly express causality. On the other hand, Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) can encode the sequential information of the input text. Melamud et al. (2016) also showed that using an LSTM results in a more precise context encoding and substantially improve performance in several tasks upon the common average-of-wordsembeddings representation. Therefore, we propose the use of LSTM RNN instead of a CNN, because we argue that LSTM has a higher capacity of encoding meaning for the task of causality classification.\nWe propose a neural network architecture with two inputs, which is mainly based on the encoding of the two inputs with an LSTM and the use of several dense layers with a tanh activation function.\nFollowing the assumption that some sort of relation should exist between the two events of a causal relation, the first evaluated model consists of two\nconnected LSTMs, or in other words, the LSTM network of the second event of the causal relation is initialized with the last state of the first LSTM. We call to this architecture “Stated Pair LSTM”. We also evaluated the same architecture but without the connection between the two LSTMs. We call to this second architecture “Pair LSTM” and it is depicted in Figure 1.\nAccording to Figure 1, the first input of the system is the first event of the relation, and the second input is the concatenation of the lexical marker and the second event. The text processing starts with the tokenization of the two inputs, and the representation of them as a matrix of word embedding vectors. The set of pre-trained embeddings used was Glove (Pennington et al., 2014), specifically the 300 dimension reference vectors of the 840B cased tokens set.\nThe lengths of the first (n) and the second (m) input are not the same, so three zero-padding strategies were evaluated to measure which of them is the most convenient to encode the causal meaning. The maximum, the mean and mode of the length of the two inputs were calculated:\n∀x ∈ IRn×d and ∀y ∈ IRm×d\npad(x) = {max(x),mean(x),mode(x)} (1)\nwhere x and y are the first and second input and d is the length of the word embedding vectors.\nSubsequently, each of the two outputs of the encoding layer are vectorized to a vector of length 100 by a dense layer with a tanh activation function. The context of the causal relation is represented by the concatenation of the two vectors.\n∀W ∈ IR100×nd and ∀ b ∈ IR100\nvec(x) : IRn×d → IRnd\ntanh(W · x+ b) context : (vec(x), vec(y))\n(2)\nThe output of the Equation 2 is processed by three dense layers activated by a tanh function. The last layer is composed of the softmax operation.\nThe performance of two learning optimizers was evaluated, specifically Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) and Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015). In order to avoid the overfitting of the classification process, different values for dropout ([0.5, 0.75]) and regularization were used ( [ 8 · 10−3, 8 · 10−6 ] )."

A similar approach was also used in (Hidey and McKeown, 2016).\nThe second baseline (B2) is the system of Hidey and McKeown (2016), which is based on SVM with a large set of features generated from the combination of features from the original parallel corpus and some lexical resources (WordNet, VerbNet and PropBank). The fact of relying on lexical resources restricts the recall of the system to the linguistic coverage of the lexical resources.

On the other hand, the good performance of B1 might indicate that the training corpus is composed of few unambiguous causal connectives. Concerning the results reached by the proposed systems, all the configurations in Table 5 outperform the baseline B1, which means that the system learns beyond the class distribution of the lexical markers in the training data.\nThose configurations that use Adadelta as optimizer outperform the system B2 in the “non bootstrapping” version of the corpus. The behaviour of B2 shows a big difference between Precision and Recall, indicating that the system has many false positives, i.e. a large number of sentences without a causal meaning. This is not a desirable behaviour. On the other hand, our system has a high Precision with lower Recall, indicating it mainly classifies correctly sentences with unambiguous connectives. Figure 2 shows that the most frequent connectives in the Causal class do not have any instance in the Non Causal class, which supports our last assertion. The best configuration (“Pair LSTM Max Adadelta”) uses the maximum operation for the zero-padding strategy and Adadelta as learning optimizer. Our proposal in this scenario improves the state of the art by 2.13% according to F1 in the Causal class (C) and 7.72% according to Accuracy.\nWe observe a similar trend in the performance of the system with the “bootstrapping” version of the corpus, i.e. the system architecture “Pair LSTM” tends to reach better results than the architecture “Stated LSTM”. This behaviour means that our assumption about the relation between the meanings of the two input events does not hold, so it is better to encode each argument independently and then to measure the relation between the arguments by using dense layers. Concerning the optimizers, the results show a similar behaviour in both architectures. The Adadelta optimizer promotes the Recall and penalizes Precision, whereas the system reaches a higher value of Precision and a smaller difference between Precision and Recall\n1For the sake of brevity, those systems that performed worse than B1 and B2 are not in Table 5.\nCorpus Method Precision C.

A high value of Precision and a high value of Recall mean that there is a good balance between the accuracy in the disambiguation of the causal meaning of the relation and the coverage of different ways of expressing causality. To conclude, the system that reached the highest performance is the one that used the mean strategy for zero-padding and the optimizer Adam.\nMost of the configurations of the proposed neural network outperform the baseline B2. If we look at the values of Precision, our proposal improves the Precision value of B2 by 3.89% . However, B2 is better 2.41% according to the Recall value. The good Recall value of B2 system entails a drop in the performance according to the Precision. This behaviour is also developed by the neural network configurations that use maximum strategy for zero-padding and Adadelta as optimizer, but in those cases the Recall and the Pre-\ncision are greater. As previously mentioned, this means that the systems have a large number of false positive instances, so they might not be correctly learning the characteristics of the Causal class.

Regarding the performance of B1 in the “non bootstrapping version”, the Precision is lower and the Recall is higher than in the previous experiments, which means that the number of false positives is large, so it is not learning the characteristics of the class Causal. As in the previous set of experiments, B1 promotes Recall and penalizes Precision in the “bootstrapping” version of the corpus, which is not a desirable behaviour.

We present some correctly classified examples by our best configuration and misclassified by B2 in Table 8. It shows the class of the instance in the test corpus and the value of the most frequent class in the training corpus. The behaviour of the verb break should be stressed since it is considered as a causative verb. However, there are some other uses of break that do not have a causal meaning (see Table 8).\nThe behaviour of the proposed system with the connective which then is also remarkable. That connective is totally ambiguous, because it only has one instance labelled as Causal and other as Non Causal in the training data.
