      "text" : "There is a growing interest in automated processing of historical documents, as evidenced by the growing field of digital humanities and the increasing number of digitally available collections of historical documents. A common approach to deal with the high amount of variance often found in this type of data is to perform spelling normalization (Piotrowski, 2012), which is the mapping of historical spelling variants to standardized/modernized forms (e.g. vnd→ und ‘and’).\nTraining data for supervised learning of historical text normalization is typically scarce. On the other hand, neural networks are said to work best when trained on large amounts of data. It is therefore not clear whether neural networks are a good\nchoice for this particular task. We explore framing the spelling normalization task as a character-based sequence-to-sequence transduction problem, and use encoder–decoder recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to induce our transduction models. This is similar to models that have been proposed for neural machine translation (e.g., Cho et al. (2014)), so essentially, our approach could also be considered a form of character-based neural machine translation.\nBy basing our model on individual characters as input, we keep the vocabulary size small, which in turn reduces the model’s complexity and the amount of data required to train it effectively. Using an encoder–decoder architecture removes the need for an explicit character alignment between historical and modern wordforms. Furthermore, we explore using an auxiliary task for which data is more readily available, namely grapheme-tophoneme mapping (word pronunciation), to regularize the induction of the normalization models.\nWe propose several architectures, including multi-task learning architectures taking advantage of the auxiliary data, and evaluate them across 44 small datasets from Early New High German.\nContributions Our contributions are as follows:\n• We are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to propose and evaluate encoder-decoder architectures for historical text normalization.\n• We evaluate several such architectures across 44 datasets of Early New High German.\n• We show that such architectures benefit from bidirectional encoding, beam search, and attention.\n• We also show that MTL with pronunciation as an auxiliary task improves the performance of architectures without attention.\n2 ACL 2017 Submission ***. Confidential Review Copy. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE. • We analyze the above architectures and show that the MTL architecture learns attention from the auxiliary task, making the attention mechanism largely redundant. • We make our implementation publicly available at anonymized. In sum, we both push the state-of-the-art in historical text normalization and present an analysis that, we believe, brings us a step further in understanding the benefits of multi-task learning."

      "heading" : "2 Datasets",
      "text" : "Normalization For the normalization task, we use a total of 44 texts from the Anselm corpus (Dipper and Schultz-Balluff, 2013) of Early New High German.1 The corpus is a collection of manuscripts and prints of the same core text, a religious treatise. Although the texts are semi-parallel and share some vocabulary, they were written in different time periods (between the 14th and 16th century) as well as different dialectal regions, and show quite diverse spelling characteristics. For example, the modern German word Frau ‘woman’ can be spelled as fraw/vraw (Me), frawe (N2), frauwe (St), fraüwe (B2), frow (Stu), vrowe (Ka), vorwe (Sa), or vrouwe (B), among others.2 All texts in the Anselm corpus are manually annotated with gold-standard normalizations following guidelines described in Krasselt et al. (2015). For our experiments, we excluded texts from the corpus that are shorter than 4,000 tokens, as well as a few for which annotations were not yet available at the time of writing (mostly Low German and Dutch versions). Nonetheless, the remaining 44 texts are still quite short for machine-learning standards, ranging from about 4,200 to 13,200 tokens, with an average length of 7,350 tokens. For all texts, we removed tokens that consisted solely of punctuation characters. We also lowercase all characters, since it helps keep the size of the vocabulary low, and uppercasing of words is usually not very consistent in historical texts. Tokenization was not an issue for pre-processing these texts, since modern token boundaries have already been marked by the transcribers. 1https://www.linguistics.rub.de/ anselm/ 2We refer to individual texts using the same internal IDs that are found in the Anselm corpus (cf. the website). Grapheme-to-phoneme mappings We use learning to pronounce as our auxiliary task. This task consists of learning mappings from sequences of graphemes to the corresponding sequences of phonemes. We use the German part of the CELEX lexical database (Baayen et al., 1995), particularly the database of phonetic transcriptions of German wordforms. The database contains a total of 365,530 wordforms with transcriptions in DISC format, which assigns one character to each distinct phonological segment (including affricates and diphthongs). For example, the word Jungfrau ‘virgin’ is represented as ’jUN-frB."

      "text" : "We propose several architectures that are extensions of a base neural network architecture, closely following the sequence-to-sequence model proposed by Sutskever et al. (2014). It consists of the following: • an embedding layer that maps one-hot input vectors to dense vectors; • an encoder RNN that transforms the input sequence to an intermediate vector of fixed dimensionality; • a decoder RNN whose hidden state is initialized with the intermediate vector, and which is fed the output prediction of one timestep as the input for the next one; and • a final dense layer with a softmax activation which takes the decoder’s output and generates a probability distribution over the output classes at each timestep. For the encoder/decoder RNNs, we use long short-term memory units (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). LSTMs are designed to allow recurrent networks to better learn long-term dependencies, and have proven advantageous to standard RNNs on many tasks. We found no significant advantage from stacking multiple LSTM layers for our task, so we use the simplest competitive model with only a single LSTM unit for both encoder and decoder. By using this encoder–decoder model, we avoid the need to generate explicit alignments between the input and output sequences, which would bring up the question of how to deal with input/output\n3\nACL 2017 Submission ***.

Another important property is that the model does not start to generate any output until it has seen the full input sequence, which in theory allows it to learn from any part of the input, without being restricted to fixed context windows.

We then train each model by minimizing the crossentropy loss across all output characters; i.e., if y = (y1, ..., yn) is the correct output word (as a list of one-hot vectors of output characters) and ŷ = (ŷ1, ..., ŷn) is the model’s output, we minimize the mean loss− ∑n i=1 yi log ŷi over all training samples. For the optimization, we use the Adam algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 0.003. To reduce computational complexity, we also set a maximum word length of 14, and filter all training samples where either the input or output word is longer than 14 characters. This only affects 172 samples across the whole dataset, and is only done during training. In other words, we evaluate our models across all the test examples."

This works fairly well, but the greedy approach can yield suboptimal global picks, in which each individual character is sensibly derived from the input, but the overall word is nonsensical. We therefore also experiment with beam search decoding, setting the beam size to 5. Finally, we also experiment with using a lexical filter during the decoding step. Here, before picking the next 5 most likely characters during beam search, we remove all characters that would lead to a string not covered by the lexicon. This is again intended to reduce the occurrence of nonsensical outputs. For the lexicon, we use all word forms from CELEX (cf. Sec. 2) plus the target word forms from the training set.3"

      "text" : "In our base architecture, we assume that we can decode from a single vector encoding of the input sequence. This is a strong assumption, especially with long input sequences. Attention mechanisms give us more flexibility. The idea is that instead of encoding the entire input sequence into a fixedlength vector, we allow the decoder to “attend” to different parts of the input character sequence at each time step of the output generation. Importantly, we let the model learn what to attend to based on the input sequence and what it has produced so far. Our implementation is identical to the decoder with soft attention described by Xu et al. (2015): we calculate a context vector from the encoder’s output and the decoder’s hidden state, and factor this vector into the hidden state of the decoder for the next timestep. Additionally, we use a bidirectional encoder in this scenario, comprised of one LSTM layer that reads the input sequence normally and another LSTM layer that reads it back3We observe that due to this filtering, we cannot reach 2.25% of the targets in our test set, most of which are Latin word forms.\n4 ACL 2017 Submission ***.

While a precise alignment of input and output sequences is sometimes difficult, most of the time the sequences align in a sequential order, which can be exploited by an attentional component."

The multitask architecture only differs from the base architecture in having two classifier functions at the outer layer, one for each of our two tasks. Our auxiliary task is to predict a sequence of phonemes as the correct pronunciation of an input sequence of graphemes. This choice is motivated by the relationship between phonology and orthography, in particular the observation that spelling variation often stems from phonological variation. We train our multi-task learning architecture by alternating between the two tasks, sampling one instance of the auxiliary task for each training sample of the main task. We use the encoderdecoder to generate a corresponding output sequence, whether a modern word form or a pronunciation. Doing so, we suffer a loss with respect to the true output sequence and update the model parameters. The update for a sample from a specific task affects the parameters of corresponding classifier function, as well as all the parameters of the shared hidden layers."

For the final evaluation, we set the size of the embedding and the recurrent LSTM layers to 128, applied a dropout of 0.3 to the input of each recurrent layer, and trained the model on mini-batches with 50 samples each for a total of 50 epochs (in the multi-task learning setup, mini-batches contain 50 samples of each task, and epochs are counted by the size of the training set for the main task only).

Baselines We compare our architectures to several competitive baselines. Our first baseline is an averaged perceptron model trained to predict output character n-grams for each input character, after using Levenshtein alignment with generated segment distances (Wieling et al., 2009, Sec. 3.3) to align input and output characters. Our second baseline uses the same alignment, but trains a deep bi-LSTM sequential tagger, following Bollmann and Søgaard (2016). We evaluate this tagger using both standard and multi-task learning. Finally, we compare our model to the rule-based and Levenshtein-based algorithms provided by the Norma tool (Bollmann, 2012).4"

While we also measure character-level metrics, minor differences on character level can cause large differences in downstream applications, so we believe that perfectly matching the output sequences is more useful. Average scores across all 43 texts are presented in Table 1 (see Appendix A for individual scores). We first see that almost all our encoder-decoder architectures perform significantly better than the four state-of-the-art baselines. All our architectures perform better than Norma and the averaged perceptron, and all the MTL architectures outperform Bollmann and Søgaard (2016). We also see that beam search, filtering, and attention lead to cumulative gains in the context of the single-task architecture – with the best architecture outperforming the state-of-the-art by almost 3% in absolute terms. 4https://github.com/comphist/norma\n5\nACL 2017 Submission ***.

In fact, attention hurts the performance of our multitask architecture quite significantly. Also note that the multi-task architecture without attention performs on-par with the single-task architecture with attention. We hypothesize that the reason for this pattern, which is not only observed in the average scores in Table 1, but also quite consistent across the individual results in Appendix A, is that our multi-task learning already learns how to focus attention. This is the hypothesis that we will try to validate in Sec. 5: That multi-task learning can induce strategies for focusing attention comparable to attention strategies for recurrent neural networks. Sample predictions A small selection of predictions from our models is shown in Table 2. They serve to illustrate the effects of the various settings; e.g., the base model with greedy search tends to produce more nonsense words (ters, ünsget) than the others. Using a lexical filter helps the most in this regard: the base model with filtering correctly normalizes ergieng to erging ‘(he) fared’, while decoding without a filter produces the non-word erbiggen. Even for herczenlichen (modern herzlichen ‘heartfelt’), where no model finds the correct target form, only the model with filtering produces a somewhat reasonable alternative (herzgeliebtes ‘heartily loved’). In some cases (such as gewarnet ‘warned’), only the models with attention or multi-task learning produce the correct normalization, but even when they are wrong, they often agree on the prediction (e.g. dicke, herzel). We will investigate this property further in Sec. 5."

Attention and multi-task also introduce new errors compared to the base model (26.6 and 29.5 per test set, respectively), and again we can observe a relatively high agreement of the models (11.8 word errors are introduced by both models).

A more recent approach is based on characterbased statistical machine translation applied to historical text (Pettersson et al., 2013; SánchezMartínez et al., 2013; Scherrer and Erjavec, 2013; Ljubešić et al., 2016) or dialectal data (Scherrer and Ljubešić, 2016). This is conceptually very similar to our approach, except that we substitute the classical SMT algorithms for neural networks. Indeed, our models can be seen as a form of character-based neural MT (Cho et al., 2014). Neural networks have rarely been applied to historical spelling normalization so far; one example is Azawi et al.

      "text" : "We presented an approach to historical spelling normalization using neural networks with an encoder-decoder architecture, and showed that it consistently outperforms several existing baselines. Encouragingly, our work proves to be fully competitive with the sequence-labeling approach by Bollmann and Søgaard (2016), without requiring a prior character alignment. Specifically, we demonstrated the aptitude of multi-task learning to mitigate the shortage of training data for the named task. We included a multifaceted analysis of the effects that MTL introduces to our models and the resemblance that it bears to attention mechanisms. We believe that this analysis is a valuable contribution to the understanding of MTL approaches also beyond spelling normalization, and we are confident that our observations will stimulate further research into the relationship between MTL and attention. Finally, many improvements to the presented approach are conceivable, most notably introducing some form of token context to the model. Currently, we only consider word forms in isolation, which is problematic for ambiguous cases (such as jn, which can normalize to in ‘in’ or ihn ‘him’) and conceivably makes the task harder for others. Reranking the predictions with a language model could be one possible way to improve on this. Ljubešić et al. (2016), for example, experiment with segment-based normalization, using segments (essentially, token n-grams) instead of single tokens as the input for their character-based SMT model, which also introduces context. Such an approach could also deal with the issue of tokenization differences between the historical and the modern text, which is another challenge often found in datasets of historical text.\n9 ACL 2017 Submission ***.

Training encoder-decoder architectures to solve such problems typically requires a lot of training data, which is not available for the named task. We address this problem by using several novel encoder-decoder architectures, including a multi-task learning (MTL) architecture using a grapheme-to-phoneme dictionary as auxiliary data, pushing the state-of-theart by an absolute 2% increase in performance. We analyze the induced models across 44 different texts from Early New High German. Interestingly, we observe that, as previously conjectured, multi-task learning can learn to focus attention during decoding, in ways remarkably similar to recently proposed attention mechanisms. This, we believe, is an important step toward understanding how MTL works.",
