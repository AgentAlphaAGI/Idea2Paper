[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Strengths:    - The paper states clearly the contributions from the beginning     - Authors provide system and dataset    - Figures help in illustrating the approach    - Detailed description of the approach    - The authors test their approach performance on other datasets and compare to other published work - Weaknesses:    -The explanation of methods in some paragraphs is too detailed and there is no mention of other work and it is repeated in the corresponding method sections, the authors committed to address this issue in the final version. \n   -README file for the dataset [Authors committed to add README file] - General Discussion:    - Section 2.2 mentions examples of DBpedia properties that were used as features. Do the authors mean that all the properties have been used or there is a subset? If the latter please list them. In the authors' response, the authors explain in more details this point and I strongly believe that it is crucial to list all the features in details in the final version for clarity and replicability of the paper. \n   - In section 2.3 the authors use Lample et al. Bi-LSTM-CRF model, it might be beneficial to add that the input is word embeddings (similarly to Lample et al.)    - Figure 3, KNs in source language or in English? ( since the mentions have been translated to English). In the authors' response, the authors stated that they will correct the figure. \n   - Based on section 2.4 it seems that topical relatedness implies that some features are domain dependent. It would be helpful to see how much domain dependent features affect the performance. In the final version, the authors will add the performance results for the above mentioned features, as mentioned in their response. \n   - In related work, the authors make a strong connection to Sil and Florian work where they emphasize the supervised vs. unsupervised difference. The proposed approach is still supervised in the sense of training, however the generation of training data doesn’t involve human interference "}, "scores": {"overall": "4", "SUBSTANCE": "5", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Oral Presentation", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "5"}, "meta": {"license": "No individual license attached", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4", "sentences": {"main": [[0, 313], [313, 554], [554, 626], [626, 733], [733, 814], [814, 846], [846, 1062], [1062, 1280], [1280, 1333], [1333, 1413], [1413, 1523], [1523, 1609], [1609, 1742], [1742, 1891], [1891, 2034]]}}}, {"rid": 1, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Strengths: - Very impressive resource - fully automatic system - particularly suitable for cross-lingual learning across many languages - Good evaluation both within and outside wikipedia. Good comparison to works that employed manual resources.\n- Weaknesses: - The clarity of the paper can be improved.\n- General Discussion: This paper presents \"a simple yet effective framework that can extract names from 282 languages and link them to an English KB\". Importantly, the system is fully automatic, which is particularly important when aiming to learn across such a large number of languages. Although this is far from trivial, the authors are able to put their results in context and provide evaluation both within and outside of wikipedia - I particularly like the way the put their work in the context of previous work that uses manual resources, it is a good scientific practice and I am glad they do not refrain from doing that in worry that this would not look good.\nThe clarity of the paper can improve. This is not an easy paper to write due to the quite complex process and the very large scale resource it generates. \nHowever, the paper is not very well organized and at many points I felt that I am reading a long list of details. I encourage the authors to try and give the paper a better structure. As one example, I would be happy to see a better problem definition and high level motivations from the very beginning. Other examples has to do with better exposition of the motivations, decisions and contributions in each part of the paper (I admire the efforts the authors have already made, but I think this can done even better). This is an important paper and it deserves a clearer presentation.\nAll in all I like the paper and think it provides an important resource. I would like to see this paper presented in ACL 2017.
