OntoLearn Reloaded: A graph-based algorithm for taxonomy induction.   - Experiments are poor, they only compare against \"Hearst patterns\" without taking into account the works previously cited.\n- General Discussion:  The paper is easy to follow and the supplementary material is also well written and useful, however the paper lack of references of is a relation extraction and taxonomization literature. The same apply for the experiments. \nIn fact no meaningful comparison is performed and the authors not even take into account the existence of other systems (more recent than hearst patterns).\nI read authors answers but still i'm not convinced that they couldn't perform more evaluations. I understand that they have a solid theoretical motivation but still, i think that comparison are very important to asses if the theoretical intuitions of the authors are confirmed also in practice. While it's true that all the works i suggested as comparison build taxonomies, is also true that a comparison is possible considering the edges of a taxonomy.\nAnyway, considering the detailed author answer and the discussion with the other reviewer i can rise my score to 3 even if i still think that this paper is poor of experiments and does not frame correctly in the is-a relation extraction / taxonomy building literature.

The motivation of the paper is easy to understand and this is an interesting task. In addition, the approach seems solid in general and the experimental results show that the approach increases in the number of fine-grained classes that can be populated.\n- Weaknesses: Some parts of the paper are hard to follow. It is unclear to me why D((e, p, o)) is multiplied by w in Eq (7) and why the weight for e in Eq. (8) is explained as the product of how often e has been observed with some property and the weight of that property for the class MH. In addition, it also seems unclear how effective introducing compositional models itself is in increasing the coverage. I think one of the major factors of the increase of the coverage is the modifier expansion, which seems to also be applicable to the baseline 'Hearst'. It would be interesting to see the scores 'Hearst' with modifier expansion.\n- General Discussion: Overall, the task is interesting and the approach is generally solid. However, since this paper has weaknesses described above, I'm ambivalent about this paper.\n- Minor comment: I'm confused with some notations. For example, it is unclear for me what 'H' stands for. It seems that 'H' sometimes represents a class such as in (e, H) (- O, but sometimes represents a noun phrase such as in (H, p, N, w) (- D. Is my understanding correct?\nIn Paragraph \"Precision-Recall Analysis\", why the authors use area under the ROC curve instead of area under the Precision-Recall curve, despite the paragraph title \"Precision-Recall Analysis\"?\n- After reading the response: Thank you for the response. I'm not fully satisfied with the response as to the modifier expansion. I do not think the modifier expansion can be applied to Hearst as to the proposed method. However, I'm wondering whether there is no way to take into account the similar modifiers to improve the coverage of Hearst. I'm actually between 3 and 4, but since it seems still unclear how effective introducing compositional models itself is, I keep my recommendation as it is.

The approach is well motivated and clearly defined and the experiments show that show that this decomposed representation can improve upon the Hearst-pattern derived IsA relations upon which it is trained in terms of coverage.\n- weaknesses The experiments are encouraging. However, it would be nice to see ROC curves for the new approach alone, not in an ensemble with Hearst patterns. Table 5 tells us that Mods_I increases coverage at the cost of precision and Figure 2 tells us that Mods_I matches Hearst pattern precision for the high precision region of the data. However, neither of these tell us whether the model can distinguish between the high and low precision regions, and the ROC curves (which would tell us this) are only available for ensembled models.\nI believe that Eqn. 7 has an unnecessary $w$ since it is already the case that $w=D(\\rangle e, p, o \\langle)$. - discussion Overall, this is a nice idea that is well described and evaluated. I think this paper would be a good addition to ACL.
