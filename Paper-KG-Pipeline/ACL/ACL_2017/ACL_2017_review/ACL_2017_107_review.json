[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "This paper presents several weakly supervised methods for developing NERs. The methods rely on some form of projection from English into another language. The overall approach is not new and the individual methods proposed are improvements of existing methods. For an ACL paper I would have expected more novel approaches.\nOne of the contributions of the paper is the data selection scheme. The formula used to calculate the quality score is quite straightforward and this is not a bad thing. However, it is unclear how the thresholds were calculated for Table 2. The paper says only that different thresholds were tried. Was this done on a development set? There is no mention of this in the paper. The evaluation results show clearly that data selection is very important, but one may not know how to tune the parameters for a new data set or a new language pair.  Another contribution of the paper is the combination of the outputs of the two systems developed in the paper. I tried hard to understand how it works, but the description provided is not clear.  The paper presents a number of variants for each of the methods proposed. Does it make sense to combine more than two weakly supervised systems? Did the authors try anything in this direction.\nIt would be good to know a bit more about the types of texts that are in the \"in-house\" dataset.

In addition, authors propose two methods to combine the output of those methods (probability-based and ranking-based), and a method to select the best training instances from cross-lingual comparable corpora. The cross-lingual projection is done using a variant of Mikolov’s proposal. In general, the paper is easy to follow, well-structured, and the English quality is also correct. The results of the combined annotations are interesting.\nDetailed comments: I was wondering which is the motivation behind proposing a Continuous Bag-of-word (CBOW) model variation. You don’t give much details about this (or the parameters employed). Was the original model (or the Continuous Skip-gram model) offering low results? I suggest to include also the results with the CBOW model, so readers can analyse the improvements of your approach. \nSince you use a decay factor for the surrounding embeddings, I suggest to take a look to the exponential decay used in [1].\nSimilarly to the previous comment, I would like to look at the differences between the original Mikolov’s cross-lingual projections and your frequency weighted projections. These contributions are more valuable if readers can see that your method is really superior.\n“the proposed data selection scheme is very effective in selecting good-quality projection-labeled data and the improvement is significant” ← Have you conducted a test of statistical significance? I would like to know if the differences between result in this work are significant.  I suggest to integrate the text of Section 4.4 at the beginning of Section 4.2. \nIt would look cleaner. I also recommend to move the evaluation of Table 2 to the evaluation section.\nI miss a related work section. Your introduction includes part of that information. I suggest to divide the introduction in two sections.\nThe evaluation is quite short (1.5 pages with conclusion section there). You obtain state-of-the-art results, and I would appreciate more discussion and analysis of the results.\nSuggested references: [1] Iacobacci, I., Pilehvar, M. T., & Navigli, R. (2016).
