[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Strengths: This paper tries to use the information from arguments, which is usually ignored yet actually quite important, to improve the performance of event detection. The framework is clear and simple. With the help of the supervised attention mechanism, an important method that has been used in many tasks such as machine translation, the performance of their system outperforms the baseline significantly.\n- Weaknesses:  The attention vector is simply the summation of two attention vectors of each part. Maybe the attention vector could be calculated in a more appropriate approach. For the supervised attention mechanism, two strategies are proposed. \nBoth of them are quite straightforward. Some more complicated strategies can work better and can be tried.\n- General Discussion:  Although there are some places that can be improved, this paper proposed a quite effective framework, and the performance is good. The experiment is solid. It can be considered to be accepted.
