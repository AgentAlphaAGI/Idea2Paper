[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Strengths: The paper broadens the applicability of readability scores to an additional language, and produces a well-validated applicability score for Vietnamese.  - Weaknesses: The greatest weaknesses, with respect to ACL are that 1) readability scores are of limited interest within the field of computational linguistics. While they are somewhat useful in educational and public communication fields, their impact on the progress of computational linguistics is limited.  A minor weakness is in the writing: the paper has numerous minor grammatical errors. \nAlthough the discussion compares the performance of the PDS1 and PDW1 features from the previous work, it is unclear how poorly the previous readability measures perform, relevant to the one developed here, for practical purposes.\n- General Discussion: This paper would be a stronger candidate for inclusion if the corpus (and importantly, labels developed) were released. It could be used more widely than the development of scalar readability metrics, and would enable (e.g.) investigation of application of more powerful feature-selection methods.

Using a combination of features such as word count, sentence length etc they train a simple regression model to estimate the readability of the documents.  One of the major weaknesses of the paper its lack of technical contribution - while early work in readability assessment employed simple methods like the one outlined in this paper, recent work on predicting readability uses more robust methods that rely on language models for instance (Eg : http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mx223/readability_bea_2016.pdf, http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kevynct/pubs/ITL-readability-invited-article-v10 -camera.pdf). A comparison with such methods could be a useful contribution and make the paper stronger especially if simple methods such as those outlined in this paper can compete with more complicated models.  Baseline experiments with SMOG, Gunning Fog index etc should also be presented as well as the other Vietnamese metrics and datasets that the authors cite.  Another problem is that while previous readability indices were more selective and classified content into granular levels corresponding to grade levels (for instance), the authors use a coarse classification scheme to label documents as easy, medium and hard which makes the metric uninteresting. ( Also, why not use a classifier?)\nThe work is probably a bit too pre-mature and suffers from significant weaknesses to be accepted at this stage. I would encourage the authors to incorporate suggested feedback to make it better.  The paper also has quite a few grammatical errors which should be addressed in any future submission.

The formula is developed based on a multiple regression analysis with three features. Furthermore, the authors have developed and annotated a new text corpus with three readability classes (easy, middle, hard).\nResearch on languages other than English is interesting and important, especially when it comes to low-resource languages. Therefore, the corpus might be a nice additional resource for research (but it seems that the authors will not publish it - is that right?). However, I don't think the paper is convincing in its current shape or will influence future research. Here are my reasons: - The authors provide no reasons why there is a need for delevoping a new formula for readability assessments, given that there already exist two formulas for Vietnamese with almost the same features. What are the disadvantages of those formulas and why is the new formula presented in this paper better?\n- In general, the experimental section lacks comparisons with previous work and analysis of results. The authors claim that the accuracy of their formula (81% on their corpus) is \"good and can be applied in practice\". What would be the accuracy of other formulas that already exist and what are the pros and cons of those existing formulas compared to the new one?\n- As mentioned before, an analysis of results is missing, e.g. which word / sentence lengths / number of difficult words are considered as easy/middle/hard by their model?\n- A few examples how their formula could be applied in a practical application would be nice as well.\n- The related work section is rather a \"background\" section since it only presents previously published formulas. What I'm missing is a more general discussion of related work. There are some papers that might be interesting for that, e.g., DuBay 2004: \"The principles of readability\", or Rabin 1988: \"Determining difficulty levels of text written in languages other than English\" - Since Vietnamese is syllable-based and not word-based, I'm wondering how the authors get \"words\" in their study. Do they use a particular approach for merging syllables? And if yes, which approach do they use and what's the accuracy of the approach?\n- All in all, the content of the paper (experiments, comparisons, analysis, discussion, related work) is not enough for a long paper.\nAdditional remarks: - The language needs improvements - Equations: The usage of parentheses and multiplying operators is inconsistent - Related works section: The usage of capitalized first letters is inconsistent "}, "scores": {"overall": "1", "SUBSTANCE": "1", "APPROPRIATENESS": "3", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Poster", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "5"}, "meta": {"license": "No individual license attached", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4", "sentences": {"main": [[0, 81], [81, 167], [167, 292], [292, 415], [415, 556], [556, 659], [659, 680], [680, 881], [881, 985], [985, 1086], [1086, 1203], [1203, 1350], [1350, 1522], [1522, 1624], [1624, 1738], [1738, 1801], [1801, 2005], [2005, 2120], [2120, 2177], [2177, 2257], [2257, 2391], [2391, 2411], [2411, 2445], [2445, 2525], [2525, 2605]]}}}]
