[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Strengths: This paper proposes to apply NLP to speech transcripts (narratives and descriptions) in order to identify patients with MCI (mild cognitive impairment, ICD-10 code F06.7). The authors claim that they were able to distinguish between healthy control participants and patients with MCI (lines 141-144). However in the conclusion, lines 781-785, they say that “… accuracy ranging from 60% to 85% …. means that it is not easy to distinguish between healthy subjects and those with cognitive impairments”. So the paper beginning is more optimistic than the conclusion but anyway the message is encouraging and the reader becomes curious to see more details about what has been actually done.\nThe corpus submitted in the dataset is constructed for 20 healthy patients and 20 control participants only (20+20), and it is non-understandable for people who do not speak Portuguese. It would be good to incorporate more technological details in the article and probably to include at least one example of a short transcript that is translated to English, and eventually a (part of a) sample network with embeddings for this transcript.\n- Weaknesses: The paper starts with a detailed introduction and review of relevant work. Some of the cited references are more or less NLP background so they can be omitted e.g. (Salton 1989) in section 4.2.3. Other references are not directly related to the topic e.g. “sentiment classification” and “pedestrian detection in images”, lines 652-654, and they can be omitted too. In general lines 608-621, section 4.2.3 can be shortened as well etc. etc. The suggestion is to compress the first 5 pages, focusing the review strictly on the paper topic, and consider the technological innovation in more detail, incl. samples of English translations of the ABCD and/or Cindarela narratives.\nThe relatively short narratives in Portuguese esp. in ABCD dataset open the question how the similarities between words have been found, in order to construct word embeddings. In lines 272-289 the authors explain that they generate word-level networks from continuous word representations. What is the source for learning the continuous word representations; are these the datasets ABCD+Cinderella only, or external corpora were used? In lines 513-525 it is written that sub-word level (n-grams) networks were used to generate word embeddings. Again, what is the source for the training? Are we sure that the two kinds of networks together provide better accuracy? And what are the “out-of-vocabulary words” (line 516), from where they come?\n- General Discussion: It is important to study how NLP can help to discover cognitive impairments; from this perspective the paper is interesting. Another interesting aspect is that it deals with NLP for Portuguese, and it is important to explain how one computes embeddings for a language with relatively fewer resources (compared to English).  The text needs revision: shortening sections 1-3, compressing 4.1 and adding more explanations about the experiments. Some clarification about the NURC/SP N. 338 EF and 331 D2 transcription norms can be given.\nTechnical comments: Line 029: ‘… as it a lightweight …’ -> shouldn’t this be ‘… as in a lightweight …’ Line 188: PLN -> NLP Line 264: ‘out of cookie out of the cookie’ – some words are repeated twice  Table 3, row 2, column 3: 72,0 -> 72.0 Lines 995-996: the DOI number is the same as the one at lines 1001-1002; the link behind the title at lines 992-993 points to the next paper in the list "}, "scores": {"overall": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "3", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Oral Presentation", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "4"}, "meta": {"license": "No individual license attached", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4", "sentences": {"main": [[0, 13], [13, 185], [185, 314], [314, 409], [409, 514], [514, 700], [700, 886], [886, 1139], [1139, 1153], [1153, 1228], [1228, 1349], [1349, 1518], [1518, 1588], [1588, 1593], [1593, 1755], [1755, 1828], [1828, 1879], [1879, 2004], [2004, 2118], [2118, 2263], [2263, 2372], [2372, 2416], [2416, 2493], [2493, 2570], [2570, 2592], [2592, 2717], [2717, 2915], [2915, 2916], [2916, 3034], [3034, 3126], [3126, 3146], [3146, 3229], [3229, 3250], [3250, 3327], [3327, 3366], [3366, 3519]]}}}, {"rid": 1, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Strengths: This paper explores is problem of identifying patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) by analyzing speech transcripts available from three different datasets. A graph based method leveraging co-occurrence information between words found in transcripts is described. Features are encoded using different characteristics of the graph lexical, syntactic properties, and many others. \nResults are reported using 5 fold cross validation using a number of classifiers. Different models exhibit different performance across the three datasets. This work targets a well defined problem and uses appropriate datasets.  - Weaknesses: The paper suffers from several drawbacks 1. The paper is hard to read due to incorrect usage of English. The current manuscript would benefit a  lot from a review grammar and spellings. \n2. The main machine learning problem being addressed is poorly described. What was a single instance of classification? It seems every transcripts was classified as MCI or No MCI. If this is the case, the dataset descriptions should describe the numbers at a transcript level. Tables 1,2, and 3 should describe the data not the study that produced the transcripts. The age of the patients is irrelevant for the classification task. A lot of text (2 pages) is consumed in simply describing the datasets with details that do not affect the end classification task. Also, I was unsure why numbers did not add up. For e.g.: in section 4.1.1 the text says 326 people were involved. But the total number of males and females in Table 1 are less than 100? \n3. What is the motivation behind enriching the graph? Why not represent each word by a node in the graph and connect them by the similarity between their vectors, irrespective of co-occurrence? \n4. The datsets are from a biomedical domain. No domain specific tools have been leveraged. \n5. Since dataset class distribution is unclear, it is unclear to determine if accuracy is a good measure for evaluation. In either case, since it is a binary classification task, F1 would have been a desirable metric. \n6. Results are reported unto 4 decimal places on very small datasets (43 transcripts) without statistical tests over increments. Therefore, it is unclear if the gains are significant.

The nature of the problem, datasets, and domain are thoroughly described. While missing some detail, the proposed solution and experiments sound reasonable. Overall, I found the study interesting and informative.\nIn terms of drawbacks, the paper needs some considerable editing to improve readability. Details on some key concepts appear to be missing. For example,  details on the multi-view learning used are omitted; the set of “linguistic features” needs to be clarified; it is not entirely clear what datasets were used to generate the word embeddings (presumably the 3 datasets described in the paper, which appear to be too small for that purpose…). It is also not clear why disfluencies (filled pauses, false starts, repetitions, etc.) were removed from the dataset. One might suggest that they are important features in the context of MCI. It is also not clear why the most popular tf-idf weighting scheme was not used for the BoW classifications. In addition, tests for significance are not provided to substantiate the conclusions from the experiments. Lastly, the related work is described a bit superficially.  Detailed comments are provided below: Abstract: The abstract needs to be shortened. See detailed notes below.\nLines 22,23 need rephrasing.            “However, MCI disfluencies produce agrammatical speech impacting in parsing results” → impacting the parsing results?\nLines 24,25: You mean correct grammatical errors in transcripts manually? It is not clear why this should be performed, doesn’t the fact that grammatical errors are present indicate MCI? … Only after reading the Introduction and Related Work sections it becomes clear what you mean. Perhaps include some examples of disfluencies.\nLines 29,30 need rephrasing: “as it a lightweight and language  independent representation” Lines 34-38 need rephrasing: it is not immediately clear which exactly are the 3 datasets.

I believe they are something along these lines: “Aluisio et al. (2016)  used…” Line 188: The definition of “PLN” appears to be missing.\nLines 233 - 235 could you some rephrasing. Lemmatization is not necessarily a last step in text pre-processing and normalization, in fact there are also additional common normalization/preprocessing steps omitted.  Lines 290-299: Did you create the word embeddings using the MCI datasets or external datasets?\nLine 322: consisted of → consist of Lines 323: 332 need to be rewritten. ... “ manually segmented of the DementiaBank and Cinderella” →  What do you mean by segmented, segmented into sentences? Why weren’t all datasets automatically segmented?; “ ABCD” is not defined; You itemized the datasets in i) and ii), but subsequently  you refer to 3 dataset, which is a bit confusing. Maybe one could explicitly name the datasets, as opposed to referring to them as “first”, “second”, “third”.\nTable 1 Caption: The demographic information is present, but there are no any additional statistics of the dataset, as described.\nLines 375 - 388:  It is not clear why filled pauses, false starts, repetitions, etc. were removed.
