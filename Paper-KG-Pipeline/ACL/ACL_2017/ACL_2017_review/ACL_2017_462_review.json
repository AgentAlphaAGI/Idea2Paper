[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Strengths: The approach described in the manuscript outperformed the previous approaches and achieved the state-of-the-art result.\nRegarding data, the method used the combination of market and text data.\nThe approach used word embeddings to define the weight of each lexicon term by extending it to the similar terms in the document.\n- Weaknesses: Deep-learning based methods were known to be able to achieve relatively good performances without much feature engineering in sentimental analysis. More literature search is needed to compare with the related works would be better.\nThe approach generally improved performance by feature-based methods without much novelty in model or proposal of new features.\n- General Discussion: The manuscript described an approach in sentimental analysis. The method used a relatively new method of using word embeddings to define the weight of each lexicon term. However, the novelty is not significant enough.

The authors evaluate information retrieval term weighting models which are seeded with a finance-oriented sentiment lexicon and expanded with word embeddings. PCA is used to reduce dimensionality before Support Vector Regression is applied for similarity estimation.\nIn addition to text-based features, the authors also use non-text-based market features (e.g. sector information and volatility estimates).\nMultiple fusion methods to combine text features with market features are evaluated.\nCOMMENTS It would be interesting to include two more experimental conditions, namely 1) a simple trigram SVM which does not use any prior sentiment lexica, and 2) features that reflect delta-IDFs scores for individual features. \nAs an additional baseline, it would be good to see binary features.\nThis paper could corroborate your references: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/57d6/29615c19caa7ae6e0ef2163eebe3b272e65a.pdf "}, "scores": {"overall": "2", "SUBSTANCE": "4", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Poster", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "5"}, "meta": {"license": "No individual license attached", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4", "sentences": {"main": [[0, 13], [13, 27], [27, 49], [49, 157], [157, 158], [158, 317], [317, 425], [425, 565], [565, 650], [650, 659], [659, 878], [878, 947], [947, 993], [993, 1072]]}}}]
