[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "The paper presents a neural model for predicting SQL queries directly from natural language utterances, without going through an intermediate formalism. \nIn addition, an interactive online feedback loop is proposed and tested on a small scale.\n- Strengths: 1\\ The paper is very clearly written, properly positioned, and I enjoyed reading it.\n2\\ The proposed model is tested and shown to perform well on 3 different domains (academic, geographic queries, and flight booking) 3\\ The online feedback loop is interesting and seems promising, despite of the small scale of the experiment.\n4\\ A new semantic corpus is published as part of this work, and additionally two existing corpora are converted to SQL format, which I believe would be beneficial for future work in this area.\n- Weaknesses / clarifications: 1\\ Section 4.2 (Entity anonymization) - I am not sure I understand the choice of the length of span for querying the search engine. Why and how is it progressively reduced? ( line 333).\n2\\ Section 5 (Benchmark experiments) - If I understand correctly, the feedback loop (algorithm 1) is *not* used for these experiments. If this is indeed the case, I'm not sure when does data augmentation occur. Is all the annotated training data augmented with paraphrases? When is the \"initial data\" from templates added? Is it also added to the gold training set? If so, I think it's not surprising that it doesn't help much, as the gold queries may be more diverse.  In any case, I think this should be stated more clearly. In addition, I think it's interesting to see what's the performance of the \"vanilla\" model, without any augmentation, I think that this is not reported in the paper.\n3\\ Tables 2 and 3: I find the evaluation metric used here somewhat unclear. \nDoes the accuracy measure the correctness of the execution of the query (i.e., the retrieved answer) as the text seem to indicate? ( Line 471 mentions *executing* the query). Alternatively, are the queries themselves compared? ( as seems to be the case for Dong and Lapata in Table 2). If this is done differently for different systems (I.e., Dong and Lapata), how are these numbers comparable? In addition, the text mentions the SQL model has \"slightly lower accuracy than the best non-SQL results\" (Line 515), yet in table 2 the difference is almost 9 points in accuracy.  What is the observation based upon? \nWas some significance test performed? If not, I think the results are still impressive for direct to SQL parsing, but that the wording should be changed, as the difference in performance does seem significant.\n4\\ Line 519 - Regarding the data recombination technique used in Jia and Liang (2016): Since this technique is applicable in this scenario, why not try it as well?  Currently it's an open question whether this will actually improve performance. Is this left as future work, or is there something prohibiting the use of this technique?\n5\\ Section 6.2 (Three-stage online experiment) - several details are missing / unclear: - What was the technical background of the recruited users?\n- Who were the crowd workers, how were they recruited and trained?\n- The text says \"we recruited 10 new users and asked them to issue at least 10 utterances\". Does this mean 10 queries *each* (e.g., 100 overall), or 10 in total (1 for each).\n- What was the size of the initial (synthesized) training  set?  - Report statistics of the queries - some measure of their lexical variability / length / complexity of the generated SQL? This seems especially important for the first phase, which is doing surprisingly well. Furthermore, since SCHOLAR uses SQL and NL, it would have been nice if it were attached to this submission, to allow its review during this period.\n6\\ Section 6.3 (SCHOLAR dataset) - The dataset seems pretty small in modern standards (816 utterances in total), while one of the main advantages of this process is its scalability. What hindered the creation of a much larger dataset?\n- Comparing performance - is it possible to run another baseline on this newly created dataset to compare against the reported 67% accuracy obtained in this paper (line 730).\n7\\ Evaluation of interactive learning experiments (Section 6): I find the experiments to be somewhat hard to replicate as they involve manual queries of specific annotators. For example, who's to say if the annotators in the last phase just asked simpler questions? I realise that this is always problematic for online learning scenarios, but I think that an effort should be made towards an objective comparison. For starters, the statistics of the queries (as I mentioned earlier) is a readily available means to assess whether this happens. Second, maybe there can be some objective held out test set? This is problematic as the model relies on the seen queries, but scaling up the experiment (as I suggested above) might mitigate this risk. Third, is it possible to assess a different baseline using this online technique? I'm not sure whether this is applicable given that previous methods were not devised as online learning methods.\n- Minor comments: 1\\ Line 48 - \"requires\" -> \"require\" 2\\ Footnote 1 seems too long to me. Consider moving some of its content to the body of the text.\n3\\ Algorithm 1: I'm not sure what \"new utterances\" refers to (I guess it's new queries from users?). I think that an accompanying caption to the algorithm would make the reading easier.\n4\\ Line 218 - \"Is is\" -> \"It is\" 5\\ Line 278 mentions an \"anonymized\" utterance. This confused me at the first reading, and if I understand correctly it refers to the anonymization described later in 4.2. I think it would be better to forward reference this.  - General Discussion: Overall, I like the paper, and given answers to the questions I raised above, would like to see it appear in the conference.\n- Author Response: I appreciate the detailed response made by the authors, please include these details in a final version of the paper.

Towards this end they employ a data augmentation approach where more data is iteratively collected from crowd annotation, based on user feedback on how well the SQL queries produced by the model do. Results on both the benchmark and interactive datasets show that data augmentation is a promising approach.\nStrengths: - No intermediate representations were used.  - Release of a potentially valuable dataset on Google SCHOLAR.\nWeaknesses: - Claims of being comparable to state of the art when the results on GeoQuery and ATIS do not support it.  General Discussion: This is a sound work of research and could have future potential in the way semantic parsing for downstream applications is done. I was a little disappointed with the claims of “near-state-of-the-art accuracies” on ATIS and GeoQuery, which doesn’t seem to be the case (8 points difference from Liang et. al., 2011)). And I do not necessarily think that getting SOTA numbers should be the focus of the paper, it has its own significant contribution. I would like to see this paper at ACL provided the authors tone down their claims, in addition I have some questions for the authors.\n- What do the authors mean by minimal intervention? Does it mean minimal human intervention, because that does not seem to be the case. Does it mean no intermediate representation? If so, the latter term should be used, being less ambiguous.\n- Table 6: what is the breakdown of the score by correctness and incompleteness? \nWhat % of incompleteness do these queries exhibit?\n- What is expertise required from crowd-workers who produce the correct SQL queries?  - It would be helpful to see some analysis of the 48% of user questions which could not be generated.\n- Figure 3 is a little confusing, I could not follow the sharp dips in performance without paraphrasing around the 8th/9th stages.  - Table 4 needs a little more clarification, what splits are used for obtaining the ATIS numbers?\nI thank the authors for their response.

The method is evaluated over two standard datasets (Geo880 and ATIS), as well as a novel dataset relating to document search.\nThis is a solid, well executed paper, which takes a relatively well established technique in the form of an encoder-decoder with some trimmings (e.g. data augmentation through paraphrasing), and uses it to generate SQL queries, with the purported advantage that SQL queries are more expressive than other semantic formalisms commonly used in the literature, and can be edited by untrained crowd workers (familiar with SQL but not semantic parsing). I buy that SQL is more expressive than the standard semantic formalisms, but then again, were there really any queries in any of your three datasets where the standard formalisms are unable to capture the full semantics of the query? I.e. are they really the best datasets to showcase the expressivity of SQL? Also, in terms of what your model learns, what fraction of SQL does it actually use? I.e. how much of the extra expressivity in SQL is your model able to capture? Also, does it have biases in terms of the style of queries that it tends to generate? That is, I wanted to get a better sense of not just the *potential* of SQL, but the actuality of what your model is able to capture, and the need for extra expressivity relative to the datasets you experiment over. Somewhat related to this, at the start of Section 5, you assert that it's harder to directly produce SQL. You never actually show this, and this seems to be more a statement of the expressivity of SQL than anything else (which returns me to the question of how much of SQL is the model actually generating).\nNext, I would really have liked to have seen more discussion of the types of SQL queries your model generates, esp. for the second part of the evaluation, over the SCHOLAR dataset. Specifically, when the query is ill-formed, in what ways is it ill-formed? When a crowd worker is required to post-edit the query, how much effort does that take them? Equally, how correct are the crowd workers at constructing SQL queries? Are they always able to construct perfect queries (experience would suggest that this is a big ask)? In a similar vein to having more error analysis in the paper, I would have liked to have seen agreement numbers between annotators, esp. for Incomplete Result queries, which seems to rely heavily on pre-existing knowledge on the part of the annotator and therefore be highly subjective.\nOverall, what the paper achieves is impressive, and the paper is well executed; I just wanted to get more insights into the true ability of the model to generate SQL, and a better sense of what subset of the language it generates.\nA couple of other minor things: l107: \"non-linguists can write SQL\" -- why refer to \"non-linguists\" here? Most linguists wouldn't be able to write SQL queries either way; I think the point you are trying to make is simply that \"annotators without specific training in the semantic translation of queries\" are able to perform the task l218: \"Is is\" -> \"It is\" l278: it's not clear what an \"anonymized utterance\" is at this point of the paper l403: am I right in saying that you paraphrase only single words at a time? \nPresumably you exclude \"entities\" from paraphrasing?\nl700: introduce a visual variable in terms of line type to differentiate the three lines, for those viewing in grayscale There are various inconsistencies in the references, casing issues (e.g. \"freebase\", \"ccg\"), Wang et al.
