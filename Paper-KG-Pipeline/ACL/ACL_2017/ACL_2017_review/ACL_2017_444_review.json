[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "This paper presents evaluation metrics for lyrics generation exploring the need for the lyrics to be original,but in a similar style to an artist whilst being fluent and co-herent. The paper is well written and the motivation for the metrics are well explained.   The authors describe both hand annotated metrics (fluency, co-herence and match) and an automatic metric for ‘Similarity'. Whilst the metric for Similarity is unique and interesting the paper does not give any evidence of this as an effective automatic metric as correlations between this metric and the others are low, (which they say that they should be used separately). The authors claim it can be used to meaningfully analyse system performance but we have to take their word for it as again there is no correlation with any hand-annotated performance metric.  Getting worse scores than a baseline system isn’t evidence that the metric captures quality (e.g. you could have a very strong baseline).\nSome missing references, e.g. recent work looking at automating co-herence, e.g. using mutual information density (e.g. Li et al. 2015). In addition, some reference to style matching from the NLG community are missing (e.g. Dethlefs et al. 2014 and the style matching work by Pennebaker).

While the assessment of the generation of creative work is very challenging and of great interest to the community, this effort falls short of its claims of a comprehensive solution to this problem.\nAll assessment of this nature ultimately falls to a subjective measure -- can the generated sample convince an expert that the generated sample was produced by the true artist rather than an automated preocess?  This is essentially a more specific version of a Turing Test.   The effort to automate some parts of the evaluation to aid in optimization and to understand how humans assess artistic similarity is valuable.  However, the specific findings reported in this work do not encourage a belief that these have been reliably identified.\nSpecifically -- Consider the central question: Was a sample generated by a target artist?        The human annotators who were asked this were not able to consistently respond to this question.        This means either 1) the annotators did not have sufficient expertise to perform the task, or 2) the task was too challenging, or some combination of the two.   The proposed automatic measures also failed to show a reliable agreement to human raters performing the same task.        This dramatically limits their efficacy in providing a proxy for human assessment.   The low interannotator agreement may be \"expected\" because the task is subjective, but the idea of decomposing the evaluation into fluency and coherence components is meant to make it more tractable, and thereby improve the consistency of rater scores.  A low IAA for an evaluation metric is a cause for concern and limits its viability as a general purpose tool.   Specific questions/comments: - Why is a line-by-line level evaluation prefered to a verse level analysis. \nSpecifically for \"coherence\", a line by line analysis limits the scope of coherence to consequtive lines.\n- Style matching -- This term assumes that these 13 artists each have a distinct style, and always operate in that style. I would argue that some of these artists (kanye west, eminem, jay z, drake, tupac and notorious big) have produced work in multiple styles.  A more accurate term for this might be \"artist matching\".\n- In Section 4.2 The central automated component of the evaluation is low tf*idf with existing verses, and similar rhyme density.  Given the limitations of rhyme density -- how well does this work.  Even with the manual intervention described?\n- In Section 6.2 -- This description should include how many judges were used in this study? In how many cases did the judges already know the verse they were judging?  In this case the test will not assess how easy it is to match style, but rather, the judges recall and rap knowledge.
