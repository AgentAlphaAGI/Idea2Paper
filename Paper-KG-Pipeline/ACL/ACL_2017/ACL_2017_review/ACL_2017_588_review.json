[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Contents: This paper proposes a new task, and provides a dataset. The task is to predict blanked-out named entities from a text with the help of an external definitional resource, in particular FreeBase. These named entities are typically rare, that is, they do not appear often in the corpus, such that it is not possible to train models specifically for each entity. The paper argues convincingly that this is an important setting to explore. Along with multiple baselines, two neural network models for the problem are presented that make use of the external resource, one of which also accumulates evidence across contexts in the same text.  - Strengths: The collection of desiderata for the task is well-chosen to advance the field: predicting blanked-out named entities, a task that has already shown to be interesting in the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, but in a way that makes the task hard for language models; and the focus on rare entities should drive the field towards more interesting models.  The collection of baselines is well chosen to show that neither a NN model without external knowledge nor a simple cosine similarity based model with external knowledge can do the task well.\nThe two main models are chosen well.\nThe text is clear and well argued.  - Weaknesses: I was a bit puzzled by the fact that using larger contexts, beyond the sentences with blanks in them, did not help the models. After all, you were in a way using additional context in the HierEnc model, which accumulates knowledge from other contexts. There are two possible explanations: Either the sentences with blanks in them are across the board more informative for the task than the sentences without. This is the explanation suggested in the paper, but it seems a bit unintuitive that this should be the case. Another possible explanation is that the way that you were using additional context in HierEnc, using the temporal network, is much more useful than by enlarging individual contexts C and feeding that larger C into the recurrent network.  Do you think that that could be what is going on?\n- General Discussion: I particularly like the task and the data that this paper proposes. This setup can really drive the field forward, I think. This in my mind is the main contribution.

The authors highlight the importance of the problem, given that the entities come from a long-tailed distribution. They use popular sequence encoders to encode the context and the definitions of candidate entities, and score them based on their similarity with the context. While it is clear that the task is indeed important, and the dataset may be useful as a benchmark, the approach has some serious weaknesses and the evaluation leaves some questions unanswered.  - Strengths: The proposed task requires encoding external knowledge, and the associated dataset may serve as a good benchmark for evaluating hybrid NLU systems.\n- Weaknesses: 1) All the models evaluated, except the best performing model (HIERENC), do not have access to contextual information beyond a sentence. This does not seem sufficient to predict a missing entity. It is unclear whether any attempts at coreference and anaphora resolution have been made. It would generally help to see how well humans perform at the same task.\n2) The choice of predictors used in all models is unusual. It is unclear why similarity between context embedding and the definition of the entity is a good indicator of the goodness of the entity as a filler.\n3) The description of HIERENC is unclear. From what I understand, each input (h_i) to the temporal network is the average of the representations of all instantiations of context filled by every possible entity in the vocabulary. \nThis does not seem to be a good idea since presumably only one of those instantiations is correct. This would most likely introduce a lot of noise.\n4) The results are not very informative. Given that this is a rare entity prediction problem, it would help to look at type-level accuracies, and  analyze how the accuracies of the proposed models vary with frequencies of entities.\n- Questions to the authors: 1) An important assumption being made is that d_e are good replacements for entity embeddings. Was this assumption tested?\n2) Have you tried building a classifier that just takes h_i^e as inputs?\nI have read the authors' responses. I still think the task+dataset could benefit from human evaluation. This task can potentially be a good benchmark for NLU systems, if we know how difficult the task is. The results presented in the paper are not indicative of this due to the reasons stated above. Hence, I am not changing my scores.

The authors propose Rare Entity prediction task to demonstrate this is the case. However, the motivation of the task is not fully justified. \nWhy is this task important? How would real world NLP applications benefit from this task? The paper lacks a convincing argument for proposing a new task. For current reading comprehension task, the evidence for a correct answer can be found in a given text, thus we are interested in learning a model of the world (i.e causality for example), or a basic reasoning model. Comparing to reading comprehension, rare entity prediction is rather unrealistic as humans are terrible with remembering name. The authors mentioned that the task is difficult due to the large number of rare entities, however challenging tasks with the same or even more difficult level exist, such as predicting correct morphological form of a word in morphologically rich languages. Such tasks have obvious applications in machine translation for example.\n- General Discussion: It would be helpful if the authors characterize the dataset in more details. \nFrom figure 1 and table 4, it seems to me that overlapping entities is an important feature. There is noway i can predict the **blank** in figure 1 if I don't see the word London in Peter Ackoyd description. That's being said, before brutalizing neural networks, it is essential to understand the characteristic of the data and the cognitive process that searches for the right answer.\nGiven the lack of characteristic of the dataset, I find that the baselines are inappropriate. First of all, the CONTENC is a natural choice at the first sigh. \nHowever as the authors mentioned that candidate entities are rare, the embeddings of those entities are unrealizable. As a consequence, it is expected that CONTENC doesn't work well. Would it is fairer if the embeddings are initialized from pre-trained vectors on massive dataset? One would expect some sort of similarity between Larnaca and Cyprus in the embedding space and CONTENC would make a correct prediction in Table 4. What would be the performance of TF-IDF+COS and AVGEMB+COS if only entities are used to compute those vectors?\nFrom modeling perspective, I appreciate that the authors chose a sigmoid predictor that output a numerical score between (0,1). This would help avoiding normalization over the list of candidates, which are rare and is difficult to learn reliable weights for those. However, a sidestep technique does exist, such as Pointer Network. A representation h_i for C_i (*blank* included) can be computed by an LSTM or BiLSTM, then Pointer Network would give a probabilistic interpretation p(e_k|C_i) \\propto exp(dot(d_{e_k}, h_i)). In my opinion, Pointer Network would be an appropriate baseline. Another related note: Does the unbalanced set of negative/positive labels affect the training? During training, the models make 1 positive prediction while number of negative predictions is at least 4 times higher?\nWhile I find the task of Rare Entity prediction is unrealistic, having the dataset, it would be more interesting to learn about the reasoning process that leads to the right answer such as which set of words the model attends to when making prediction.
