[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Strengths: Useful application for teachers and learners; supports fine-grained comparison of GEC systems.\n- Weaknesses: Highly superficial description of the system; evaluation not satisfying.\n- General Discussion: The paper presents an approach of automatically enriching the output of GEC systems with error types. This is a very useful application because both teachers and learners can benefit from this information (and many GEC systems only output a corrected version, without making the type of error explicit). It also allows for finer-grained comparison of GEC systems, in terms of precision in general, and error type-specific figures for recall and precision.\nUnfortunately, the description of the system remains highly superficial. The core of the system consists of a set of (manually?) created rules but the paper does not provide any details about these rules. The authors should, e.g., show some examples of such rules, specify the number of rules, tell us how complex they are, how they are ordered (could some early rule block the application of a later rule?), etc. -- Instead of presenting relevant details of the system, several pages of the paper are devoted to an evaluation of the systems that participated in CoNLL-2014. Table 6 (which takes one entire page) list results for all systems, and the text repeats many facts and figures that can be read off the table.  The evaluation of the proposed system is not satisfying in several aspects. \nFirst, the annotators should have independently annotated a gold standard for the 200 test sentences instead of simply rating the output of the system. Given a fixed set of tags, it should be possible to produce a gold standard for the rather small set of test sentences. It is highly probable that the approach taken in the paper yields considerably better ratings for the annotations than comparison with a real gold standard (see, e.g., Marcus et al. (1993) for a comparison of agreement when reviewing pre-annotated data vs. annotating from scratch). \nSecond, it is said that \"all 5 raters individually considered at least 95% of our rule-based error types to be either “Good” or “Acceptable”\". \nMultiple rates should not be considered individually and their ratings averaged this way, this is not common practice. If each of the \"bad\" scores were assigned to different edits (we don't learn about their distribution from the paper), 18.5% of the edits were considered \"bad\" by some annotator -- this sounds much worse than the average 3.7%, as calculated in the paper. \nThird, no information about the test data is provided, e.g. how many error categories they contain, or which error categories are covered (according to the cateogories rated as \"good\" by the annotators). \nForth, what does it mean that \"edit boundaries might be unusual\"? A more precise description plus examples are at need here. Could this be problematic for the application of the system?\nThe authors state that their system is less domain dependent as compared to systems that need training data. I'm not sure that this is true. E.g., I suppose that Hunspell's vocabulary probably doesn't cover all domains in the same detail, and manually-created rules can be domain-dependent as well -- and are completely language dependent, a clear drawback as compared to machine learning approaches. Moreover, the test data used here (FCE-test, CoNLL-2014) are from one domain only: student essays.\nIt remains unclear why a new set of error categories was designed. One reason for the tags is given: to be able to search easily for underspecified categories (like \"NOUN\" in general). It seems to me that the tagset presented in Nicholls (2003) supports such searches as well. Or why not using the CoNLL-2014 tagset? Then the CoNLL gold standard could have been used for evaluation.\nTo sum up, the main motivation of the paper remains somewhat unclear. Is it about a new system? But the most important details of it are left out. Is it about a new set of error categories? But hardly any motivation or discussion of it is provided. Is it about evaluating the CoNLL-2014 systems? But the presentation of the results remains superficial.\nTypos: - l129 (and others): c.f. - > cf.\n- l366 (and others): M2 -> M^2 (= superscribed 2) - l319: 50-70 F1: what does this mean? 50-70%?\nCheck references for incorrect case - e.g. l908: esl -> ESL - e.g. l878/79: fleiss, kappa "}, "scores": {"overall": "2", "SUBSTANCE": "2", "APPROPRIATENESS": "4", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Poster", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "4"}, "meta": {"license": "No individual license attached", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "3", "sentences": {"main": [[0, 108], [108, 195], [195, 217], [217, 319], [319, 521], [521, 673], [673, 746], [746, 802], [802, 878], [878, 1082], [1082, 1090], [1090, 1248], [1248, 1392], [1392, 1393], [1393, 1469], [1469, 1622], [1622, 1742], [1742, 2025], [2025, 2169], [2169, 2289], [2289, 2544], [2544, 2749], [2749, 2816], [2816, 2875], [2875, 2936], [2936, 3045], [3045, 3077], [3077, 3337], [3337, 3436], [3436, 3503], [3503, 3621], [3621, 3713], [3713, 3753], [3753, 3819], [3819, 3889], [3889, 3915], [3915, 3966], [3966, 4009], [4009, 4068], [4068, 4115], [4115, 4172], [4172, 4179], [4179, 4207], [4207, 4213], [4213, 4263], [4263, 4302], [4302, 4310], [4310, 4346], [4346, 4370], [4370, 4400]]}}}, {"rid": 1, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "The paper presents a novel approach for evaluating grammatical error correction (GEC) systems. This approach makes it possible to assess the performance of GEC systems by error type not only in terms of recall but also in terms of precision, which was previously not possible in general since system output is usually not annotated with error categories.\nStrengths:  - The proposed evaluation is an important stepping stone for    analyzing GEC system behavior. \n - The paper includes evaluation for a variety of systems. \n - The approach has several advantages over previous work:    - it computes precision by error type    - it is independent of manual error annotation    - it can assess the performance on multi token errors  - The automatically selected error tags for pre-computed error spans    are mostly approved of by human experts Weaknesses:  - A key part – the rules to derive error types – are not described. \n - The classifier evaluation lacks a thorough error analysis and based    upon that it lacks directions of future work on how to improve the    classifier. \n - The evaluation was only performed for English and it is unclear how    difficult it would be to use the approach on another language.\nClassifier and Classifier Evaluation ==================================== It is unclear on what basis the error categories were devised. Are they based on previous work?\nAlthough the approach in general is independent of the alignment algorithm, the rules are probably not, but the authors don't provide details on that.  The error categories are a major part of the paper and the reader should at least get a glimpse of how a rule to assign an error type looks like.\nUnfortunately, the paper does not apply the proposed evaluation on languages other than English.  It also does not elaborate on what changes would be necessary to run the classifier on other languages. I assume that the rules used for determining edit boundaries as well as for determining the error tags depend on the language/the pre-processing pipeline to a certain extent and therefore need to be adapted. Also, the error categories might need to be changed.  The authors do not provide any detail on the rules for assigning error categories (how many are there overall/per error type? how complex are they?) to estimate the effort necessary to use the approach on another language.\nThe error spans computed in the pre-processing step seem to be inherently continuous (which is also the case with the M2 scorer), which is problematic since there are errors which can only be tagged accurately when the error span is discontinuous. In German, for example, verbs with separable prefixes are separated from each other in the main clause: [1st constituent] [verb] [other constituents] [verb prefix]. Would the classifier be able to tag discontinuous edit spans?\nThe authors write that all human judges rated at least 95\\% of the automatically assigned error tags as appropriate \"despite the degree of noise introduced by automatic edit extraction\" (295). I would be more cautious with this judgment since the raters might also have been more forgiving when the boundaries were noisy. In addition, they were not asked to select a tag without knowing the system output but could in case of noisy boundaries be more biased towards the system output. Additionally, there was no rating option between \"Bad (Not Appropriate)\" and \"Appropriate\", which might also have led raters to select \"Appropriate\" over \"Bad\". To make the evaluation more sound, the authors should also evaluate how the human judges rate the classifier output if the boundaries were manually created, i.e. without the noise introduced by faulty boundaries.\nThe classifier evaluation lacks a thorough error analysis. It is only mentioned that \"Bad\" is usually traced back to a wrong POS tag. Questions I'd like to see addressed: When did raters select \"Bad\", when \"Appropriate\"? Does the rating by experts point at possibilities to improve the classifier?\nGold Reference vs. Auto Reference ================================= It is unclear on what data the significance test was performed exactly. Did you test on the F0.5 scores? If so, I don't think this is a good idea since it is a derived measure with weak discriminative power (the performance in terms of recall an precision can be totally different but have the same F0.5 score). Also, at the beginning of Section 4.1 the authors refer to the mismatch between automatic and reference in terms of alignment and classification but as far as I can tell, the comparison between gold and reference is only in terms of boundaries and not in terms of classification.\nError Type Evaluation ===================== I do not think it is surprising that 5 teams (~line 473) failed to correct any unnecessary token error. For at least two of the systems there is a straightforward explanation why they cannot handle superfluous words. The most obvious is UFC: Their rule-base approach works on POS tags (Ng et al., 2014) and it is just not possible to determine superfluous words based on POS alone. Rozovskaya & Roth (2016) provide an explanation why AMU performs poorly on superfluous words.\nThe authors do not analyze or comment the results in Table 6 with respect to whether the systems were designed to handle the error type. For some error types, there is a straight-forward mapping between error type in the gold standard and in the auto reference, for example for word order error. It remains unclear whether the systems failed completely on specific error types or were just not designed to correct them (CUUI for example is reported with precision+recall=0.0, although it does not target word order errors). In the CUUI case (and there are probably similar cases), this also points at an error in the classification which is neither analyzed nor discussed.\nPlease report also raw values for TP, FP, TN, FN in the appendix for Table 6. This makes it easier to compare the systems using other measures. Also, it seems that for some error types and systems the results in Table 6 are based only on a few instances. This would also be made clear when reporting the raw values.\nYour write \"All but 2 teams (IITB and IPN) achieved the best score in at least 1 category, which suggests that different approaches to GEC complement different error types.\" ( 606) It would be nice to mention here that this is in line with previous research.\nMulti-token error analysis is helpful for future work but the result needs more interpretation: Some systems are probably inherently unable to correct such errors but none of the systems were trained on a parallel corpus of learner data and fluent (in the sense of Sakaguchi et al, 2016) corrections.\nOther ===== - The authors should have mentioned that for some of the GEC   approaches, it was not impossible before to provide error   annotations, e.g. systems with submodules for one error type each. \n  Admittedly, the system would need to be adapted to include the   submodule responsible for a change in the system output. Still, the   proposed approach enables to compare GEC systems for which producing   an error tagged output is not straightforward to other systems in a   unified way.\n- References: Some titles lack capitalizations. URL for Sakaguchi et   al. (2016) needs to be wrapped. Page information is missing for   Efron and Tibshirani (1993).\nAuthor response =============== I agree that your approach is not \"fatally flawed\" and I think this review actually points out quite some positive aspects. The approach is good, but the paper is not ready.\nThe basis for the paper are the rules for classifying errors and the lack of description is a major factor.        This is not just a matter about additional examples. If the rules are not seen as a one-off implementation, they need to be described to be replicable or to adapt them.\nGeneralization to other languages should not be an afterthought.  It would be serious limitation if the approach only worked on one language by design.  Even if you don't perform an adaption for other languages, your approach should be transparent enough for others to estimate how much work such an adaptation would be and how well it could reasonably work.  Just stating that most research is targeted at ESL only reinforces the problem.\nYou write that the error types certain systems tackle would be \"usually obvious from the tables\".  I don't think it is as simple as that -- see the CUUI example mentioned above as well as the unnecessary token errors.  There are five systems that don't correct them (Table 5) and it should therefore be obvious that they did not try to tackle them. However, in the paper you write that \"There is also no obvious explanation as to why these teams had difficulty with this error type\".
