[{"rid": 0, "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "- Strengths: The paper addresses a long standing problem concerning automatic evaluation of the output of generation/translation systems.\nThe analysis of all the available metrics is thorough and comprehensive.\nThe authors demonstrate a new metric with a higher correlation with human judgements The bibliography will help new entrants into the field.\n- Weaknesses: The paper is written as a numerical analysis paper, with very little insights to linguistic issues in generation, the method of generation, the differences in the output from a different systems and human generated reference.\nIt is unclear if the crowd source generated references serve well in the context of an application that needs language generation.\n- General Discussion: Overall, the paper could use some linguistic examples (and a description of the different systems) at the risk of dropping a few tables to help the reader with intuitions.
