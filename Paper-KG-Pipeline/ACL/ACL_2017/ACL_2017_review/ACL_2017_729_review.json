The proposed approach detects rumors more quickly and with a higher accuracy compared to the one obtained by the state of the art methods.\nThe data set should be made public for research purposes.\nTypos need to be fixed (e.g. 326/3277: any subgraph which have->has; 472: TPK->PTK; 644: Table 2 show+s), missing information needs to be added (875: where was it published?), information needs to be in the same format (e.g. 822 vs 897). Figure 5 is a bit small.
