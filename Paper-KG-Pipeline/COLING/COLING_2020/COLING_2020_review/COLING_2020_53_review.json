[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "The paper studies review generation given a set of attribute identifiers such as user ID, product ID and rating. As this information is scarce, the authors propose to select more information related to these attributes to enrich the generation process. The evaluation results, obtained by comparison with other approaches and human judgments, are promising.\nThe paper is appropriate for the conference, well-written and easy to follow. The addressed problem is interesting, and the approach and obtained results are promising. The idea of \"enriching\" the input information by collecting other reviews that are related to the input is interesting and solves the problem of having almost no information at the beginning of the process.\nIn the SL-Reflect part, it is said that a ground-truth review Y is obtained. This Y review is very important for the rest of the process, but how is it obtained? Would it be available if this is the first review of a particular product or by a specific user?\nI am also curious about how this technology could be used in the real world... As a user who reads reviews when choosing to buy something, do I want to rely on \"false\" reviews that could not be accurate or express the real characteristics of the product? On the other hand, I think this kind of approach could be very useful to give a user the first draft of his/her review, which can later be corrected in a short time and be more beneficial for other users...
