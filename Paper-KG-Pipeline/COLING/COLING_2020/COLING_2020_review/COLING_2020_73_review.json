[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "The paper addresses the problem of ASpect-Category Sentiment Analysis, where implicit aspects appearing in Laptop and Restaurant Reviews datasets denotes the main challange.\nThe paper is well written and clear. The use of multiple examples improves the clarity of the definitions and the analysis of results.\nThe authors provide extensive evaluation on multiple proposed approaches using two datasets.\nIn addition, the work provides nice ablation experiments in addition to focusing on the performance of the proposed techniques on the challenging portion of the dataset that includes implicit aspects. \nThus, providing interesting insight on a challenging direction.\nYet, the only weakness I see is that the baseline methods compared to Hier-*-BERT are somehow weak(Table2). \nHave you checked the main reasons/challenges in misclassifying the explicit and implicit aspects?\nI suggest placing the related work section at the beginning of the paper.
