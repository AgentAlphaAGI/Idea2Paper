[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "This paper introduces a process to normalize discrepancies between three different graph-based MRs based on linguistic justifications. In specific, they use the AM dependency trees produced by Lindemann et al. (2019), divided them into several manually designed local patterns, and compare the differences between multiple AM trees of the same sentence in the local pattern-level. Findings from the comparison are quantified and used to guide further manually normalization process.\nStrengths: - The paper design a sophisticated process to normalize three graph-based MR, achieving a significant improvement in several cross-formalism similarity measurements.\n- The paper is well written.\nWeaknesses: - Although a large improvement is shown in cross-formalism similarity, it isn't clear whether the normalization can benefit downstream applications. The paper reports only a small improvement in parsing F1 score under a low-resource multi-task setting. In the full resource setting, there is a \"slight to moderate decrease\" in terms of parsing accuracy. Admittedly it's related to the specific parsers being used, but there is still a possibility that the normalization process leads to some unwanted changes.
