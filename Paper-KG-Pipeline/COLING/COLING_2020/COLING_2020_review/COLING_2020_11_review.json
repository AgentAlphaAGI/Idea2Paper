[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "“An Anchor-Based Automatic Evaluation Metric for Document Summarization” Authors propose a variant of the ROUGE family of metrics for summarization evaluation that uses the source document rather than reference summaries. They evaluate the proposed metric for correlation with human judgement of summaries on TAC 2008 and 09 datasets. Relevant comparison with all recently proposed alternatives for ROUGE including embedding based metrics.\nIdea for anchors is clean and novel and accounts for lexical and semantic variations between reference and system outputs and the source documents.  Nice, focussed contribution for a short paper.
