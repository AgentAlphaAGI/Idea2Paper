[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "It is a meaningful work to construct an event-oriented dataset with user relations, TWEETSUM, for social summarization task. The authors filter and annotate the data in a disciplined manner to get the dataset, and make several typical baselines of extractive summarization methods to verify the effectiveness of the TWEETSUM dataset. But I think this paper still needs to be improved in the following aspects. \n1. The TWEETSUM dataset only contains 12 real world hot events, and the scale of this dataset maybe limited. Could the authors expand the dataset easily? or Could the authors supply the plan for the expansion of the dataset in the future? \n2. I suggest the authors describe the content of user profile in the dataset in more detail, and the authors should further discuss Table 1 and Figure 2, so that readers can understand the dataset details easily. \n3. The authors should select one more model as comparison to verify the influence of social signals, not only SNSR. \n4. The authors should make revisions to the references according to the format of COLING template.
