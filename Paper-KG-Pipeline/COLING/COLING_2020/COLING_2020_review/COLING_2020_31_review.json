[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "The paper presents a novel method for Bilingual Dictionary Induction, by introducing character-level Bilingual Orthography Embeddings, which are used in combination with the standard Bilingual Word Embeddings. Which source of information (BWE vs. BOE) is used is trained, using also additional information (manual features). The experiments are based on English-Russian (a good choice to show transliteration accuracy on a reasonable non-trivial language pair).\nThe paper is technically very well written. The classification model which is the core of the proposed method is clearly described. The evaluation is on a publicly available new shared task dataset (BUCC 2020).  As a weakness I find the absence of error analysis and its possible implications for improving the model. This is related to the absence of any linguistic insight of which cases are handled well and which not (the numbers, especially on the NEWS10 dataset, are really low, so some examples and/or analysis would be definitely very helpful).
