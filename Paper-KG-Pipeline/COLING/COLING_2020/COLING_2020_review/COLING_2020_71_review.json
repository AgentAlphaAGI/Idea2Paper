[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "This paper is a resource paper. The resource it introduces is a corpus of Russian texts, annotated with semantic change judgements, following the DURel framework. The authors describe the annotation procedure and the corpus, and also provide some baseline experiments on the automatic detection of semantic change. The corpus is promised to be published upon acceptance.\nThis is a very good paper and should definitely be accepted. Since it follows an already established annotation framework, it is not innovative in that sense, but having corpora in different languages annotated according to the same framework is a big win for the community.  The only real issue with the paper that I see is that the pre-Sowiet era is much longer than the other two. It is conceivable that this early data set is inconsistent in itself, and it would be good if the authors comment on this.\nMinor things: - There are some missing articles in the text (4.1: „loses old sense“ → „loses an old sense“; „naturally captures the type of meaning change“ → „naturally captures the following types of meaning changes“, ...). Critical proofreading would be good for the final version.\n- The authors state that the corpus will be published unter a „permissive“ license, which is surprisingly vague. I‘d assume that the authors know which license can be used by now. The wish of course would be to use a creative commons license.
