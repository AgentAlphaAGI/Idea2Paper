[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "This paper revisits a solution posed in an earlier paper which detects metaphor by directly modeling shifts in sensorimotor modality, but which used simpler machine learning methods. Several papers have since been published which do not directly model modality but make use of sophisticated neural language modeling methods to make significant gains. This paper shows that on a more even playing field, a neural method in combination with modality outperform these other models.\nStrengths: • Clear hypothesis and argumentation • Strong result which shows the contributions of the individual components Weaknesses: • Could use better motivation of specifically why the BiLSTM model with attention was chosen. Why not use BERT, since this has been shown to be very effective on this task? \n• Would be nice to see some followup analysis of what the model gets wrong. Where is the next improvement going to come from?
