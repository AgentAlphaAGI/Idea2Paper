[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "This paper proposes an approach for incoporating traditional features for automated essay scoring by simple concatenation with the vector representation of the essay resulting from neural scoring models. Such approach was tested on different neural architectures, including the most recent BERT pretrained language models and the existing hybrid system.  Strength: - A simple method to incorporate traditional features that is shown to improve neural scoring models quite significantly (p-value < 0.05).\nWeakness: - There's no comparison with existing work, or the state-of-the-art in the topic, especially the DNN-based ones which are listed in the related work section (Sec 2.3 and 2.4).\n- The study on handcrafted essay features is not eye-opening, Table 5 only suggests that \"each handcrafted feature contributes to some extent\". It would be better if a comprehensive ablation study was conducted, to understand which traditional features contribute the most (and the least), especially given the BERT pretrained models for encoding.
