[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "This paper presents an interesting and systematic comparative evaluation of two non-transformer and three transformer approaches to fine-grained NER. Although it does not contain new work as such, the detailed evaluation is useful and looks sound.  It's interesting to see that CRF has the best precision but the transformer models have much better recall --- this is useful for building applications where one is more important than the other.  The comparison across text domains is also interesting and useful.\nThe authors commendably provide a brief section explaining assumptions and potential weaknesses of the work.
