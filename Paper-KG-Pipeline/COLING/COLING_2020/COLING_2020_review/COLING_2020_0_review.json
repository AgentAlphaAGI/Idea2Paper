[{"rid": "0", "reviewer": null, "report": {"main": "The paper first describes a contrastive dataset for evaluating four different aspects of user-generated content that are challenging for MT, containing both the original expression, and a \"corrected\" version. It then goes on to perform a detailed evaluation of five in-house MT systems, varying on interesting dimensions, and two commercial systems. Performing both automatic evaluation and error analysis, with an interesting analysis. I think this is a solid contribution!\nStrengths: - Interesting new dataset - both for new phenomena, and a language pair with limited resources for this type of evaluation - Solid evaluation using the new dataset, to come to interesting conclusions about a range of NMT techniques I think \"brand-new solution\" is a bit of over-selling your point. The work that you mentioned are related to yours, and share some aspects. So I think you can phrase this a bit differently.\nIt is not clear to me if there is always one phenomena per sentence, or if there can be more. Can you please specify!\nIn 5.1 I think you mean an improvement of 1.2 Bleu points, not 1.7 (DeepL vs Google), or otherwise I misunderstood the comparison.\nSection 6 has a weird title: \"Discussion\", which implies that it contains a discussion of the previous parts. I would call it something actually related to the contents of the section, like \"correlation with human evaluation\".\nPlease provide a reference to the robustness shared task when it is first mentioned in the introduction.\nThere are some grammatical issues, here are issues from the abstract: \"plentiful of noises\" -> \"considerable noise\" \"these input\" -> \"these types of input/expressions\" \"Though its importance being recognized\" -> \"Though its importance has been recognized\" "}, "scores": {"overall": "5", "Originality": "4", "Readability_clarity": "4", "Relevance": "5", "Reproducibility": "4", "Substance": "3"}, "meta": {"license": "No individual license attached", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4", "sentences": {"main": [[0, 209], [209, 350], [350, 437], [437, 475], [475, 486], [486, 609], [609, 718], [718, 784], [784, 858], [858, 908], [908, 1002], [1002, 1026], [1026, 1157], [1157, 1267], [1267, 1384], [1384, 1489], [1489, 1745]]}}}]
