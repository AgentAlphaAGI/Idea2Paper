      "text" : "The availability of comparable treebanks – syntactically annotated corpora – for a growing number of typologically distinct languages (most prominently in the collaborative Universal Dependencies project (Nivre et al., 2016)) has led to a recent surge of interest in computational work aiming to detect systematic patterns in the grammatical systems of natural languages and/or to test hypotheses from theoretical work in language typology against empirical evidence. The treebank-based approach (Liu, 2010; Lochbihler, 2017; Gerdes et al., 2019; Bjerva et al., 2019c; Hahn et al., 2020) adds a more data-driven perspective to a strand of research in computational typology (Daumé and Campbell, 2007; Malaviya et al., 2017; Oncevay et al., 2019; Bjerva et al., 2019a; Bjerva et al., 2019b) that is based on carefully curated typological databases such as WALS1 (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013) or URIEL2 (Littell et al., 2017).\nThe established computational modeling approaches targeting systematic patterns in typological databases essentially rely on the language features that the long tradition of typological research has identified as most relevant for identifying language universals. Examples of such features are the relative order of verbs and their objects, and the order of nouns and their dependents such as adjectives, numerals and genitives. In the computational research relying on typological knowledge bases, the features are typically assumed to be Boolean and universals are formulated as propositional formulae. A major focus has been on (a) detecting universals that have the form of an implication between two typological variables, and (b) predicting the value of unknown features in typological databases based on systematic patterns in attested grammatical systems. Graphical models have been widely used to calculate the strength of an implication (Daumé and Campbell, 2007; Lu, 2013; Bjerva et al., 2019b; Bjerva et al., 2019a). While this approach is suitable if one wants to marginalize out the influence of confounding variables, it also constraints the investigated universals to have the form of an implication consisting of one implicand and usually one (but possibly multiple) implicant(s).\nIn principle, comparable treebanks can provide the basis for observing the empirical distribution of arbitrary grammatical patterns and thus explore a much larger space of potential candidates for universal typological properties – including combinations of more than two variables that cannot be reduced to logical implication. However, an integration of such an approach with linguistically grounded hypothesis\nPlace licence statement here for the camera-ready version. 1https://wals.info/ 2http://www.cs.cmu.edu/˜dmortens/uriel.html\nchecking has to address two related challenges: (i) a theoretically guided way of navigating the enormous space of candidate propositions has to be developed, and (ii) a perspicuous framework is required for expressing multi-variable propositions and for evaluating them empirically against a full collection of comparable treebanks – while doing justice to the possibility of language-internal variation and tentative preferences by modeling features as real-valued.\nThis paper proposes an expressive framework that addresses the latter challenge. We specify a formalism and its semantics to evaluate typological formulae of arbitrary logical complexity. The core elements of our framework are customizable which gives prospective users the freedom to use their own implementations.\nWe also include a method for counteracting the bias in the sample of well-studied languages (which are much more likely to be included among the languages with a treebank), many of which are phylogenetically closely related, while other language families are only very sparsely represented.\nTo demonstrate its usefulness for empirical hypothesis testing, we run a number of experiments: 1) We re-evaluate established universals to test whether the evidence for universals provided by the framework reflects the broad consent. 2) Universals are always evaluated on a subset of all natural languages. We investigate how reliable it is to transfer the evaluation result obtained from a subset of languages or language families to unknown languages. 3) We use the framework to search new potential universals.\nThe framework and our experiments are available at [link-to-GitHub-repository]."

Other examples for manyvalued logics are described in e.g. Smith (2012) and many other works. We chose fuzzy logic because the notion of fuzzy sets is detached from the probabilistic dependence of typological properties. Properties like “SVO” and “prepositions” are both a subtype of head-initiality and therefore not independent under a linguistic point of view."

      "heading" : "3.3 Phylogenetic weighting",
      "text" : "To confirm a typological universal, it is not sufficient to validate it on as many languages as possible, it is also necessary to validate it on languages from many language families. For example, if a candidate for a universal is tested on English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Japanese and the universal holds for all of them but Japanese, then Japanese is not simply an outlier, it is also possible that the “universal” only holds within the Indo-European languages. Traditionally, typologists counteract the influence of overrepresented language families through different sampling methods (cf. Bickel (2011), Song (2018)), e.g. sampling only languages with different values (on the properties of interest) for each family (Dryer, 1989; Bickel, 2008). This “genealogical sampling”, however, requires binary/categorical values and a representative database of the world’s languages, and is not applicable in our experiments with the UD treebanks. Thus, we give each language family equal importance by setting the weight function to\nw(φ, `) =  w(φ, parent(`)) |siblings(`)|+ 1 if ` has a parent\n1 otherwise . (13)\nThe weights for the current example are shown in Figure 1. This approach does not undersample languages, instead all available data is used. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel method that maximizes the usage of all available data while alleviating the sampling bias in the data.3 We believe its utility is worth further examination, however, in our preliminary experiments, the phylogenetic weighting demonstrates better agreement with the existing universals from the literature than the unweighted average.4\n3There are other works also using phylogenetic information but in different ways (Dunn et al., 2011; Levinson and Gray, 2012; Jäger, 2018).\n4In a comparison with the Universals Archive (UA) (Plank and Filimonova, 2000), we found that averaging with phylogenetic weighting achieved more similar results to the typological studies than an unweighted average. The similarity was measured by calculating the mean absolute error between the framework score and the UA score over a set of 51 universals in the UA. For each universal, the UA lists tested languages and counterexamples. The UA score was defined as the percentage of examined languages which are no counterexamples.\nAs Bickel (2011) and Dryer (2018) point out, geography is also an important factor, i.e. neighboring languages are more likely to have common properties than distant languages. However, both works agree that measuring geographic distance of languages brings its own complications and therefore it is not taken up in this paper."

      "heading" : "4 Experiments",
      "text" : "The goal of our experiments is to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for empirical exploration of the language-typological space beyond simple implications and Boolean variables. The framework is to serve as a methodological tool and should ultimately be complemented with a theoretically motivated agenda for exploring systematic correlations among underexplored properties of grammatical systems. To establish how the framework can be used we proceed in three steps: First, we re-evaluate some famous universals of Greenberg (1963) and discuss the interpretations of varying truth values and standard deviations (Sec. 4.1).\nIn the second step, we demonstrate a scenario for testing unexplored candidates for typological universals (which can consist of arbitrary formulae from propositional logic) against the full spectrum of treebanks, taking into variability with respect to each property in the real-valued logic. We work with a simple procedure of generating candidate formulae: taking over the shape of potentially relevant logical combinations from established universals and replacing the properties they include with new ones. A framework is useful for empirical exploration if its diagnostics are robust: a statement capturing a systematic relationship should generalize from one sufficiently large sample of languages to another. We test this by splitting the set of treebanks in an estimation set and a held-out set (Sec. 4.2).\nFinally, we enumerate implications of two variables from a selected set of single-link properties and discuss the top-scoring formulae, also in comparison to the findings from previous work on binary properties (Sec. 4.3)."

      "heading" : "4.1 Evaluation of Greenberg’s universals",
      "text" : "The framework can be used to evaluate universals proposed in typological literature. The most important example are the 45 universals by Greenberg (1963). 14 of them can be expressed with the UD variables from section 3.1. Most of these universals shown in Table 1 are implications, except for #1 (absolute) and #2 (equivalence). The most complex formula in the list is #16 which is composed of four variables.\nThe formulae are ranked by framework score, i.e. the weighted average truth value. 11 of the formulae score 0.90 or higher, i.e. they could be classified as “very true”. #2 is an equivalence and #16 is a quasiequivalence which are generally harder to fulfil than one-way implications (in fuzzy logic, the truth value of an equivalence is defined as the minimum of the truth values of the two composed implications). The formula with the lowest score, #13, is a good example for two conflicting universal tendencies, namely 1) the tendency to order subordinate clause and main verb the same as object and verb (this is predicted by different linguistic theories, e.g. the head-dependent theory), and 2) the tendency to put clauses after their single-word siblings (e.g. Dryer (2003)).\nσ denotes the (weighted) standard deviation which ranges between 0 and 0.5. A value of 0 means that the formula is equally true for all languages; a value of 0.5 means that the formula is absolutely true for half of the languages and absolutely false for the other half. Compare e.g. #3 (VSO⇒ prepositions) and #4 (SOV ⇒ postpositions) – and the respective Figures 2 (a) and (b) – which have similar values for s but different values for σ. Most of the 90 languages in the treebanks show (near) 0% VSO order or 100% prepositions and therefore get a truth value of 1 for #3. Only some languages (at the bottom-left corner\n5Addition is not a logical connective but used here to calculate the value of properties which have not been directly extracted from the UD treebanks. For example, the degree to which a language has S-O order is the percentage occupied by V-S-O, SV-O and S-O-V constructions. Thus, the value v`nsubj:noun-obj:noun can be calculated as v ` verb-nsubj:noun-obj:noun + v ` nsubj:noun-verb-obj:noun + v`nsubj:noun-obj:noun-verb. Addition is restricted to variables that are calculated with the same denominator (compare eq. (7)).\nof Figure 2 (a)) get lower truth values for #3 which raises the standard deviation to 0.01. Regarding #4, there are more languages showing mid-range values for SOV order and postpositons, and therefore also mid-range truth values for #4. Since most languages still have a high truth value for #4, the score remains at 0.96 but the standard deviation of 0.12 signals a greater number of languages with truth values diverging from that score."

      "heading" : "4.2 Universal prediction",
      "text" : "For the second experiment, we generate over 200k formulae from the Greenbergian universals in Table 1 by keeping the structures and varying the variables. Logical tautologies are excluded by prohibiting the variables from appearing more than once within the same formula.\nWe evaluate these formulae in six runs. In each run, we randomly split the languages into two disjunct sets for every formula and evaluate it on both sets separately. The idea is to predict the score for the second set of languages from the score on the first set of languages. Ideally, the scores from both sets should be identical. After each run, we take the two values s1(φ), s2(φ) for every formula φ and calculate the overall root-mean-square error (RMSE):\nRMSE =\n√ 1 |Φ| · ∑ φ∈Φ |s2(φ)− s1(φ)|2 (14)\nThis measures how similar our predictions are to the actual values. Since we are especially interested in high-scoring universals, we additionally calculate the RMSE on only those value pairs where s1(φ) ≥ 90%.\nThe six runs differ in the split method. 1) The languages are split either on the language, subfamily or family level. For the latter two, the languages of a (sub)family are either completely in the first or the second set. 2) The languages/subfamilies/families are either split 50%/50% or 20%/80%. The second percentages are more realistic since there is often data for a few languages/families from which one wants to predict how true a universal is in general.\nThe results in Table 2 illustrate two things. The less surprising finding is that evaluations on two balanced sets are more similar than evaluations on imbalanced sets. Arguably, because an evaluation on 20% of the data is much less representative than an evaluation on 80% of the data. Also, splitting on the language level yields more similar evaluation results than evaluating on two sets with completely different (sub)families. The second finding is that the RMSE is generally lower for formulae that are very true in at least one set of languages. This is also visible in Figure 3, the data points scatter in the shape of a lens around the identity graph, i.e. formulae that are found to be very true or very false on one set of\nlanguages are likely to achieve a similar score on a completely different set of languages. Formulae with mid-range truth values (0.2–0.8), on the other hand, exhibit a much larger variance. This indicates that certain formulae have a higher potential of being universals than others. For subfamilies and families, the prediction error increases (the appendix contains scatter plots for all six runs)."

In the third experiment, we choose ten dependency relations6 and calculate pairwise implications between the corresponding single-link properties. Since each relation can be left- or right-directed, there are 20 × 20 possible implications (the appendix contains the table with all implications).7\nTable 3 ranks the implications by average truth value. As a matter of fact, the subject precedes its head in the majority of UD languages, resulting in high scores for implications where “HEAD-nsubj” is the antecedent or “nsubj-HEAD” is the consequent (principle of explosion). Those implications are responsible for about half of the rows in Table 3. For example,\n(#19) HEAD-advmod⇒ nsubj-HEAD and (#20) advmod-HEAD ⇒ nsubj-HEAD\nare completely uninformative implications, since they both achieve a score of 0.92 but have complementary antecedents.

The single-link properties without POS are very similar to those with the most frequent POS.

(2019b). This shows that corpus statistics can gain advantage over knowledge bases in some cases.\nLast but not least, completely new universals are suggested, e.g. the following four and their composition in (1).\n(#13) HEAD-aux⇒ HEAD-case\n(#14) HEAD-aux⇒ nmod-HEAD\n(#23) HEAD-aux⇒ det-HEAD\n(#24) HEAD-aux⇒ nummod-HEAD\n(1) a.

      "heading" : "5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "This paper proposes a framework for the expression of typological statements which uses real-valued logics to capture the empirical truth value of a formula in a given collection of comparable treebanks. We demonstrate the application of the framework by evaluating established formulae as well as new formulae generated from a search algorithm. The components of the framework can be customized: users not working with the Universal Dependencies can simply exchange the data component; the weighting approach we provide can also be easily exchanged.\nIf a user wants to empirically check their own linguistic features, it is straightforward to obtain the relative frequencies from the treebank collection, complementing existing curated databases such as WALS. Very little manual work is needed. Both approaches have their pros and cons: typological knowledge bases could be subjective or incomplete, while data from the treebanks are subject to problems such as annotation inconsistencies, genre differences etc.\nThis paper discussed some experiments which have the purpose of providing an illustration of the expressiveness of the framework, focusing here on word-order variables. However, other variables could be expressed as well, and the framework also supports inclusion and combination of variables from completely different sources (e.g. phonological properties of a language), as long as the values range between 0 (false) and 1 (true). This especially allows using variables from corpora and from typological knowledge bases together."

To illustrate the usefulness of such a framework, we present experiments on the Universal Dependencies treebanks for two use cases: (i) empirical (re-)evaluation of established formulae against the spectrum of available treebanks and (ii) evaluating new formulae (i.e. potential candidates for universals) generated by a search algorithm.",
