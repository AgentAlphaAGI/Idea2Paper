      "text" : "“The biggest deficit we have in our society, and in the world right now, is an empathy deficit. We are in great need of people being able to stand in somebody else‘s shoes and see the world through their eyes.” Barack Obama in 2009 when talking to students in Istanbul\nAs Barack Obama, former president of the United States, stated, empathy is not only an elementary skill for our society and daily interaction but also for professional communication as well as successful teamwork and thus elementary for educational curricula (i.e., Learning Framework 2030 (OECD, 2018)). It is the “ability to simply understand the other person’s perspective [. . . ] and to react to the observed experiences of another” (Davis (1983), p.1), which is defined as empathy.1 Empathy skills not only pave the foundation for successful interaction in digital companies, e.g., in agile work environments (Luca and Tarricone, 2001), but they are also one of the key abilities in the future that might distinguish human work force and artificial intelligence agents (Poser and Bittner, 2020). However, besides the growing importance of empathy, research has shown that empathy skills of US college students have decreased from 1979 to 2009 by more than thirty percent and even more rapidly from 2000 to 2009 (Konrath et al., 2011). On these grounds, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) claims that training empathy skills should receive a more prominent role in today’s higher education (OECD, 2018). To train empathy to students, educational institutions traditionally rely on experiential learning scenarios, such as shadowing, communication skills training or role playing (Lok and Foster, 2019; van Berkhout and Malouff, 2016). Individual empathy training is therefore only available for a limited number of students, since individual tutoring through a student’s learning journey is often hindered due to traditional large-scale lectures or the growing field of distance learning scenarios such as Massive Open Online Classes (MOOCs) (Seaman et al., 2018). However, to develop skills such as empathy, it is of great importance for the individual student to receive continuous feedback throughout their learning journey (Hattie and Timperley, 2007; Vygotsky, 1980). In fact, educational institutions are limited in providing these individual learning conditions especially for empathy skill training.\n1Being aware that empathy is a multidimensional construct, in this study we focus on emotional and cognitive empathy (Spreng et al., 2009; Davis, 1983).\nOne possible path for providing individual learning conditions is to leverage recent developments in Computational Linguistics in the form of computer-assisted writing, which enables the development of writing support systems that provide tailored feedback and recommendations (Santos et al., 2018) (e.g., already used for argumentation skill learning (Wambsganss et al., 2020)). However, even if the detection of empathy in texts has been gaining attention recently, annotated corpora based on rigorous annotation schemes and annotation studies to train predictive models are rather rare in current literature (Buechel et al., 2018). Nevertheless, for the detection of emotions, NLP has made major progress, with sentiment analysis being one of the most prominent areas in recent years (Liu, 2015). Recently, studies have also started investigating more elaborated models of human emotions (e.g., Wang et al. (2016), AbdulMageed and Ungar (2017), Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez (2017) or Buechel and Hahn (2018)), but available corpora for empathy detection are rather rare. As Buechel et al. (2018) and Strapparava and Mihalcea (2007) argue, one reason for that might be that the construction of corpora for empathy and emotion detection and modelling in general - usually based on psychological theory - are more challenging compared to usual sentiment analysis. Most existing works for empathy detection focus on spoken dialogue, addressing conversational agents, psychological interventions or call center applications (e.g., McQuiggan and Lester (2007), Pérez-Rosas et al. (2017) or Alam et al. (2018)). Only a few studies address the detection and prediction of empathy in natural texts (Khanpour et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2012), and to the best of our knowledge only one corpus is publicly available for empathy modelling based on news story reactions (Buechel et al., 2018). Past literature in Computational Linguistics therefore lacks 1) publicly available empathy annotated data sets, 2) empathy annotation models based on rigorous annotation guidelines combined with annotation studies to assess the quality of the data and 3) the alignment of empathy in literature on psychological constructs and theories.\nIn order to overcome these limitations, we introduce an empathy annotation scheme for student-written peer reviews. Moreover, we present a corpus of 500 student-written peer reviews that are annotated for the three types of review components strengths, weaknesses and suggestions for improvements and their emotional and cognitive empathy level embedded and based on psychological theory (Davis, 1983; Spreng et al., 2009). Our contribution is threefold: 1) we derive a novel annotation scheme for a new data domain, empathy modeling based on psychological theory and previous work on annotation schemes for empathy modeling (Buechel et al., 2018); 2) we present an annotation study based on 92 student peer reviews and three annotators to show that the annotation of empathy in student peer reviews is reliably possible; 3) to the best of our knowledge we present the second freely available corpus for empathy detection in general and the first corpus for empathy detection in the educational domain based on 500 student peer reviews collected in our lecture about business innovation in German. We therefore hope to encourage future research on student-generated empathetic texts and on writing support systems to train empathy skills of students based on Natural Language Processing (NLP)."

      "text" : "The ability to perceive the feelings of another person and to react to their emotions in the right way requires empathy – the ability “of one individual to react to the observed experiences of another” (Davis (1983), p.1). Empathy plays an essential role in daily life in many practical situations, such as client communication, leadership or agile teamwork. Despite the interdisciplinary research interest, the term empathy is defined from multiple perspectives in terms of its dimensions or components (Decety and Jackson, 2004). Being aware that there are multiple perspectives on empathy, in this annotation study we were focusing on the cognitive and emotional components of empathy as defined by Davis (1983) and Lawrence et al. (2004). Therefore, we follow the “Toronto Empathy Scale” (Spreng et al., 2009) as a synthesis of instruments for measuring and validating empathy. Empathy refers to the “ability to simply understand the other person’s perspective [. . . ] and to react to the observed experiences of another” (Davis (1983), p.1), where empathy consists of both emotional and cognitive components (Spreng et al., 2009). While emotional empathy lets us perceive what other people feel, cognitive empathy is the human ability to recognize and understand other individuals (Lawrence et al., 2004)."

      "heading" : "2.2 Emotion and Empathy Detection",
      "text" : "In NLP the detection of empathy in texts is usually regarded as a subset of emotion detection, which in turn is often referred to as being part of sentiment analysis. The detection of emotions in texts has made major progress, with sentiment analysis being one of the most prominent areas in recent years (Liu, 2015). However, most scientific studies have been focusing on the prediction of polarity of words for assessing negative and positive notions. This has been done for various domains such as for online forums (Abbasi et al., 2008) or twitter postings (Rosenthal et al., 2018). Moreover, researchers also started investigating more elaborated models of human emotions (e.g., Wang et al. (2016), Abdul-Mageed and Ungar (2017), Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez (2017), Buechel et al. (2018)). Several corpora exist where researchers annotated and assessed the emotional level of texts. As early as in 1994, Scherer and Wallbott (1994) published an emotion-labelled corpus containing 7,665 sentences labeled with single emotions from a choice of seven different emotional states. Strapparava and Mihalcea (2007) used 1,250 instances of news headlines to classify emotions and valence, based on the basic emotion scale of Ekman (1992) (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise). Emotion categories are assigned a score from 0-100. More recently, Chen et al. (2018) published EmotionLines, an emotion corpus of multi-party conversations, as the first dataset with emotion labels for all utterances only based on their textual content. A total of 29,245 utterances from 2,000 dialogues have been annotated by 5 annotators according to one of seven emotions. Bostan and Klinger (2018) presented a novel unified domain-independent corpus based on eleven emotions as the common label set. However, besides multiple corpora being available for emotion detection in texts, available corpora for empathy detection are rather rare. As Buechel et al. (2018) also outline, the construction of corpora for empathy detection and empathy modelling might be less investigated due to various psychological perspectives on the construct of empathy. Most existing works for empathy detection focus therefore rather on spoken dialogue, addressing conversational agents, psychological interventions or call center applications (e.g., McQuiggan and Lester (2007), Pérez-Rosas et al. (2017), Alam et al. (2018)) than on written texts. Consequently, there are hardly any corpora available in different domains and languages to enable researchers to train models to detect the empathy level in texts, e.g., for providing students with individual empathy feedback (Buechel et al., 2018)."

      "heading" : "2.3 Empathy Annotated Corpora and Annotation Schemes in Natural Language Texts",
      "text" : "Only a few studies address the detection and prediction of empathy in natural language texts (e.g., Khanpour et al. (2017), Xiao et al. (2012)). To the best of our knowledge, only one corpus is publicly available for empathy modelling (Buechel et al., 2018). Presenting the first gold standard data set for empathy detection at all, Buechel et al. (2018) constructed a corpus in which crowdworkers (e.g., from MTurk) were asked to write emphatic reactions to news stories. Before the writing tasks, the crowdworkers were asked to conduct a short survey with self-reported items to measure their empathy level and their personal distress based on Batson et al. (1987). The scores from the survey were then taken as the annotation score for the overall news reaction message. The final corpus consists of 1,860 annotated messages, between 48 and 198 tokens long, based on 403 crowdworker participants. Besides the novel concept of their corpus, we argue that the corpus of Buechel et al. (2018) faces certain limitations: 1) the annotations are not based on rigorous annotation guidelines combined with annotation studies by researchers to assess the quality of the corpora (i.e., as done for corpora of other writing support tasks, e.g., argumentative student essays by Stab and Gurevych (2017)), and 2) the annotations are conducted on the overall document level, resulting in one generic score for the whole reaction message, which makes the corpus harder to apply for writing support systems.\nConsequently, there is a lack of linguistic corpora for empathy detection in general and more specifically for training models that provide students with adaptive support and feedback about their empathy in common pedagogical scenarios in large-scale lectures or the growing field of MOOCs (Santos et al., 2018). We aim to address this literature gap by presenting and evaluating an annotation scheme as well as an annotated empathy corpus built on student-written texts with the objective of enabling researchers to develop novel empathy writing support systems for students."

      "text" : "We compiled a corpus of 500 student-generated peer reviews in which students provide each other with feedback on previously developed business models. Peer reviews are a modern learning scenario in largescale lectures, enabling students to reflect on their content, receive individual feedback from peers and thus deepen their understanding of the content (Rietsche and Söllner, 2019). Moreover, they are easy to set up in traditional large-scale learning scenarios or in the growing field of distance-learning scenarios such as MOOCs. This can be leveraged to train skills such as the ability to appropriately react to other students’ perspective (e.g., Santos et al. (2018)). Therefore, we aim to create an annotated corpus to provide empathy feedback based on a data set that A) is based on real-world student peer reviews, B) consists of a sufficient corpus size to be able to train models in a real-world scenario and C) follows a novel annotation guideline for guiding the annotators towards an adequate agreement. Hence, we propose an new annotation scheme to model peer review components as well as their emotional and cognitive empathy level that reflects the feedback discourse in peer review texts. We base our empathy annotation scheme on emotional and cognitive empathy following Davis (1983) and Spreng et al. (2009) guided by the study of Buechel et al. (2018). To build a reliable corpus, we followed a four step methodology, illustrated in Figure 1: 1) we examined scientific literature and theory on the construct of empathy and on how to model empathy structures in texts from different domains; 2) we randomly sampled 92 studentgenerated peer reviews and, on the basis of our findings from literature and theory, developed a set of annotation guidelines consisting of rules and limitations on how to annotate emphatic review discourse structures; 3) we applied, evaluated and improved our guidelines with three native speakers in a total of eight consecutive workshops to resolve annotation ambiguities; 4) we applied the final annotation scheme based on our 14-page guidelines2 on a corpus of 500 student-generated peer reviews."

Here, a fellow student from the same course elaborates on the strengths and weaknesses of the business model and gives recommendations on what could be improved.

Most of the peer reviews in our corpus follow a similar structure. They describe several strengths or weaknesses of the business model under consideration, backing them up by examples or further elaboration. Moreover, the students formulated certain suggestions for improvements of the business model. These review components (i.e., weakness, strength and suggestion for improvement) are written with different empathetic levels, sometimes directly criticizing content harshly, sometimes empathetically referring to weaknesses as further potential for improvement with examples and explanation. We aim to capture these emphatic differences by critically\n2For details, the interested reader may refer to the supplementary material.

Our basic annotation scheme is illustrated in Figure 2.\n3.2.1 Review Components\nFor the review components, we follow established models of feedback structures suggested by feedback theory (e.g., Hattie and Timperley (2007) or Black and Wiliam (2009)). A typical peer review therefore consists of three parts: 1) elaboration of strengths, 2) elaboration of weaknesses and 3) suggestions for improvements (to answer “Where am I going and how am I going?” and “Where do I go\nnext?”, i.e., Hattie and Timperley (2007)). Accordingly, the content of a review consists of multiple components, including several controversial statements (e.g., a claim about a strength or weakness of a business model) that are usually supported by elaborations or examples (i.e., a premise) (Toulmin, 1984). Also in the domain of student-written peer reviews, we found that a standpoint and its elaboration are the central element of a review component. Accordingly, we summarized all claims and premises which describe positive aspects of a business model as strengths. All content (claims and premises) describing negative aspects are modelled as weaknesses, while claims and premises with certain content for improvement are modelled as suggestions for improvements following the structure of a typical review (Hattie and Timperley, 2007; Black and Wiliam, 2009)."

      "text" : "To capture the differences in the empathy level of the peer reviews (i.e., the way the writer is conveying her feedback (Hattie and Timperley, 2007)), we followed the approach of Davis (1983) and Spreng et al. (2009) of cognitive and emotional empathy (taking perspective and empathetic concern). Cognitive\nempathy (perspective taking) is the writer’s ability to use cognitive processes such as role taking, perspective taking or “decentering” while evaluating the peers’ submitted tasks. The student sets aside her own perspective and “steps into the shoes of the other”. Cognitive empathy can happen purely cognitively in that there is no reference to any affective state (Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright, 2004) but mostly includes understanding the other’s emotional state as well. The following example displays high cognitive empathy: “You could then say, for example, ‘Since market services are not differentiated according to customer segments and locations, the following business areas result... And that due to the\ngiven scope of this task you will focus on the Concierge-Service business segment.’ After that, you have correctly only dealt with this business segment.” Emotional empathy (emphatic concern) is the writer’s emotional response to the peers’ affective state. The students can either show the same emotions as read in the review or simply state an appropriate feeling towards the peer. Typical examples include sharing excitement with the peer about the business model submitted or showing concern over the peer’s opinion. The following example depicts high emotional empathy: “I think your idea is brilliant!”.\nBoth constructs are measured on a scale from 1-5 following the empathy scale range of Moyers and Martin (2010), with every level being precisely defined in our annotation guidelines. A summary of the definitions for both empathy level scores are displayed in Table 1 and Table 2.3\nBelow, we listed one example of an entire peer review with the corresponding annotations of strength, weakness and suggestions for improvements and the annotated cognitive and emotional empathy score.4\n“In my opinion, the solution offers real added value for the mobile customer, who wants as little waiting time as possible in his daily routine.

Firstly, many take-away shops, especially at train stations, are already optimally geared to speed. Secondly, it becomes difficult for employees to keep track of online orders, prepare them on time and then assign them to the right customer. This is especially true as it is central to the service that the items are actually ready at the time of arrival and that the customers receive the right order. Personally, the storyboard is quite rough and makes it difficult to follow all the steps of the customer process. How is step 2 to be understood in detail, e.g.?” weakness (cognitive empathy level 4, emotional empathy level 3)\n“You should add more details.

Inspired by Stab and Gurevych (2017),\n3More elaborated definitions, examples and key word lists for both empathy scales can be found in our annotation guidelines. 4Since the original texts are written in German, we translated the examples to English for the sake of this paper.\nour guidelines consisted of 14 pages, including definitions and rules for how the review components are composed, which annotation scheme is to be used and how the cognitive and emotional empathy level are to be judged. Several private training sessions and eight team workshops were performed to resolve disagreements among the annotators and to reach a common understanding of the annotation guidelines. We used the tagtog annotation tool,5 which provides a graphical interface for marking up text units and offers an environment for cloud-based annotation in a team. After the first 92 reviews were annotated by all three annotators, we calculated the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores (see Section 4.1). As we obtained satisfying results, we proceeded with two annotators annotating 130 remaining documents each and one annotator annotating 148 peer reviews, resulting in 408 additional annotated documents and 500 annotated documents in our final corpus."

      "text" : "Concerning the review components, two strategies were used. Since there were no predefined markables, annotators not only had to identify the type of review component but also its boundaries. In order to assess the latter, we use Krippendorff’s αU (Krippendorff, 2004), which allows for assessing the reliability of an annotated corpus, considering the differences in the markable boundaries. To evaluate the annotators’ agreement in terms of the selected category of a review component for a given sentence, we calculate percentage agreement and two chance-corrected measures, multi-π (Fleiss, 1971) and Krippendorff’s α (Krippendorff, 1980). Since each annotation always covers a full sentence (or a sequence of sentences), we operated at the sentence level for calculating the reliability of the annotations in terms of the IAA.\nTable 3 displays the resulting IAA scores. We obtained an IAA of 96.41% for the strengths, 88.93% for the weaknesses and 89.48% for the suggestions for improvement. The corresponding multi-π scores are 88.71%, 74.34% and 68.75%. Regarding\nKrippendorff’s α, scores of 88.71%, 74.34% and 68.75% are obtained, indicating an almost perfect agreement for the strengths components and a substantial agreement for both the weaknesses and the suggestions for improvement. With a score of 51.81%, 31.09% and 35.12%, the unitized α of strengths, weaknesses and suggestions for improvement annotations is slightly smaller compared to the sentencelevel agreement. Thus, the boundaries of review components are less precisely identified in comparison to the classification into review components. Yet the scores still suggest that there is a moderate level of agreement between the annotators for the strengths and a fair agreement for the weaknesses and the suggestions for improvement. With a score of αU=90.32%, the boundaries of not annotated text units are more reliably detected, indicating an almost perfect agreement between the annotators. Percentage agreement, multi-π and Krippendorff’s α as well are considerably higher for the not annotated spans as compared to strengths, weaknesses and suggestions for improvement (93.30%, 83.12%, 83.12%), indicating an almost perfect agreement between the annotators. Hence, we conclude that the annotation of the review components in student-generated peer reviews is reliably possible.\n5https://tagtog.net/\n4.1.2 Empathy Level\nTo assess the reliability of the cognitive and emotional empathy level annotations, we calculated the multi-π for both scales. For the cognitive empathy level we received a multi-π of 40.70% and for the emotional empathy level a multi-π of 41.22% (see Table 4), suggesting a moderate agreement between the annotators in both cases. Therefore, we conclude that the empathy level can be reliably annotated in studentwritten peer reviews, too."

      "text" : "To analyze the disagreement between the three annotators, we created a confusion probability matrix (CPM) (Cinková et al., 2012) for the review components and the empathy level scores. A CPM contains the conditional probabilities that an annotator assigns a certain category (column) given that another annotator has chosen the category in the row for a specific item. In contrast to traditional confusion matrices, a CPM also allows for the evaluation of confusions if more than two annotators are involved in an annotation study (Stab and Gurevych, 2014).\nTable 5 shows that there is broad agreement between the annotators in distinguishing between the different types of review components. The major disagreement is between suggestions and weaknesses, though with a score of 60% agreement is still fairly high. Consequently, the annotation of review components in terms of strengths, weak-\nnesses and suggestions for improvements yields highly reliable results.\nThe CPMs for the empathy levels (see Tables 3 and 46) reveal that there is a higher confusion between the scores assigned by the three reviewers, as compared to the annotation of the review components. However, when analyzing more closely, one can see that the scores mostly vary only within a small window of two or three neighboring scores.

We propose an annotation scheme based on an annotation guideline that allows to model emotional and cognitive empathy scores based on the three annotated review components strength, weakness and suggestions for improvements in student-written peer reviews. We conduct an annotation study with three annotators using 92 student essays to evaluate our annotation scheme. The obtained inter-rater agreement of α = 0.7873 for the components and the multi-π = 0.4096 for the empathy scores indicate that the proposed annotation scheme successfully guides annotators to substantial to moderate agreement. Finally, we present our freely available corpus of 500 empathy annotated student-written peer reviews on business models and our annotation guidelines to encourage future research on the design and development of empathy writing support systems for students.",
