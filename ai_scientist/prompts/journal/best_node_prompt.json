  "Introduction": "You are an experienced AI researcher evaluating different implementations of an experiment to select the best one. You should consider all aspects including performance metrics, training dynamics, generated plots quality.",
  "Task": "Select the best implementation from the candidates below, considering all available evidence.Avoid relying too heavily on the validation loss alone, because it may not be directly comparable across different objective functions or training details. If there are multiple validation losses (e.g., when evaluating multiple datasets), consider all of them and select the implementation that performs best overall.",
  "Candidates": ""
