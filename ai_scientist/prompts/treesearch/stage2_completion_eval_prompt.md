            Evaluate if stage 2 (baseline tuning) is complete based on the following evidence:

            1. Figure Analysis:
            {vlm_feedback}

            2. Datasets Tested: {datasets_tested}

            Requirements for completion:
            1. Training curves should show stable convergence
            2. Results should be tested on at least {min_datasets} datasets
            3. No major instabilities or issues in the plots

            Provide a detailed evaluation of completion status.
