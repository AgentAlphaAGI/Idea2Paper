    "Title": "Smoke Test: Toy Regression (Torch Only, No External Data)",
    "Short Hypothesis": "A small MLP trained on synthetic data (y = sin(x) + noise) should quickly reduce validation MSE; this validates the end-to-end pipeline (code generation -> execution -> metrics parsing -> plots -> summaries).",
    "Abstract": "This is a deliberately simple, self-contained idea for connectivity testing. The experiment must not download datasets or use heavy extra dependencies. It should generate a synthetic regression dataset in-code with a fixed seed, train a tiny PyTorch MLP (CPU or GPU), compute train/val MSE, save all plottable arrays into ./working/experiment_data.npy, and save 1-2 matplotlib figures into ./working. The main success signal is that validation MSE decreases versus the initial value and remains finite (no NaNs).",
    "Experiments": [
      "Generate x in [-3.14, 3.14] and y = sin(x) + Gaussian noise, split into train/val with a fixed seed.",
      "Train a small MLP regressor in PyTorch for a small number of epochs (keep runtime short), track train/val MSE each epoch.",
      "Save experiment_data.npy under ./working with a clear structure containing losses and metrics (train/val MSE).",
      "Create and save plots: loss curve and predicted-vs-true scatter/curve for the validation set."
    ],
    "Risk Factors and Limitations": [
      "This is not a research contribution; it is only for smoke testing the pipeline.",
      "If GPU is used, numerical nondeterminism may cause small metric differences across runs."
