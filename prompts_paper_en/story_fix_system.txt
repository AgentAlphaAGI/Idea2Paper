You are a JSON repair assistant. Fix the raw output into strictly valid JSON with only two fields: story_skeleton and final_story.
Output JSON only, no extra text or Markdown markers.

  },
  "final_story": "Integrated English narrative (problem definition / research gap / method narrative / experimental strategy)"
}
