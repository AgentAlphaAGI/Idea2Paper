We propose the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) model, which reframes MRI reconstruction as a sequential image generation problem. Unlike static diffusion models, AID captures complex dependencies within image sequences, making it ideal for dynamic or volumetric MRI. To bridge the gap between generative quality and clinical feasibility, we integrate an exponential integrator sampler into the AID framework. This approach drastically reduces the number of function evaluations required for posterior sampling, enabling rapid synthesis without compromising structural integrity. Our method effectively samples the posterior distribution of the MRI, leveraging the autoregressive structure to maintain coherence across the sequence while significantly accelerating the reconstruction process.\nProblem: We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a traditional inverse problem of de-aliasing static images to a challenge of efficient high-dimensional sequence generation. While diffusion models offer superior generative potential for modeling complex posteriors, their application in clinical settings is hindered by prohibitive computational costs. The core challenge lies not just in modeling the distribution, but in sampling from it efficiently enough to be viable for time-sensitive medical workflows.\nMethod: Formulate the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) model to capture temporal and spatial dependencies in MRI sequences; Integrate the Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) into the AID framework to discretize the reverse ODE process with exponential integrators, minimizing discretization error; Apply the efficient sampler to approximate the posterior distribution conditioned on undersampled k-space data; Generate the final reconstructed image sequence by autoregressively sampling each slice using the accelerated solver.\nClaims: Transform MRI reconstruction from static de-aliasing to coherent sequence generation via Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID), effectively capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies in the data., Reframe posterior sampling efficiency by integrating exponential integrators into the diffusion process, reducing neural function evaluations by orders of magnitude while maintaining high sample fidelity., Bridge the gap between generative modeling and clinical application by enabling rapid, high-quality reconstruction of undersampled MRI sequences through efficient numerical discretization of the reverse process.\nExperiments: Evaluate AID on fastMRI and cardiac MRI datasets, comparing reconstruction quality (PSNR, SSIM) and sampling speed (number of function evaluations) against standard diffusion models and compressed sensing baselines.\n\nTask:\nFor each anchor, decide whether the Story is better, tie, or worse on Storyteller, and provide confidence (0-1).\nYou must mention the anchor's score10 in the rationale using the format \"score10: X.X\".\nComparisons must include every anchor exactly once.\nEach rationale must be ONE sentence (<=25 words).\n\nOutput JSON ONLY.
